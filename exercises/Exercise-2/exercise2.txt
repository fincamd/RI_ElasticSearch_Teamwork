Pseudo-code for related terms search emulation

We could start by searching for the n most relevant documents on alcoholism.

And then feed each one to a query to ElasticSearch such as this one:

where {postToFeedSelfText} would be the selftext content of each post taken from
the previous request

body = {
    "query": {
        "more_like_this" : {
            "fields" : ["selftext"],
            "like" : {postToFeedSelfText},
            "min_term_freq" : 1,
            "max_query_terms" : 12
        }
    }
}

This could be generated using some python script using string composition and
python f"" formatting
