I'm a 25 year old girl, I have lived away from home before, but currently I rent the basement flat from my parents, below their place. So I kind of don't live with them, yet kinda do. \n\nMy mother is super super paranoid about everything, especially alcohol. I don't blame her, her aunt died from complications of prolonged alcohol abuse and her mother (my grandmother) also went through it. \n\nBut, she is constantly calling me an alcoholic. My definition is someone who cannot go without alcohol and 'needs' it. Fair enough, I do drink a fair amount, I go out a lot, especially because a lot of my friends are bartenders. \n\nIt doesn't matter what I say to her, she thinks because I drink a lot, I must be an alcoholic. Am I, and i'm kidding myself, or is my mother really just being paranoid?"
