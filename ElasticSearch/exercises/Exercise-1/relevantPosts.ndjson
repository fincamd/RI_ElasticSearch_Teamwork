I had decided my problem wasn't alcohol *per se* just that it was exacerbating my own emotional instability. \n\nI went to AA meetings when I first quit and it didn't really connect with me. I listened to other people's stories and I thought, \"well, I don't have that physical compulsion to drink, I must not be an alcoholic.\" I still abstained and I did so for eight months. I was fine going to bars, being around friends drinking etc without feeling the need to drink. \n\nOf course, it turned out that regardless of whether I have that compulsion, it's the risk of what I could turn into when I drink that is the problem. \n\nI am taking my alcoholism an order of magnitude more seriously this time around. I've been to AA meetings almost every single day for the last 18 days. I've opened my ears and unlike the last time I am actually hearing stories that resonate with me of which I can relate. I have shared at most of them. A lot of it is repetition but saying stuff out loud over and over again helps me come to terms with myself. I have met people and exchanged phone numbers and I am slowly developing a network. I still haven't started the steps, I don't have a sponsor or a home group, but I am taking my time. \n\nIt's broken me out of my rationalization and justification for certain beliefs I had about interpersonal relationships, love and romance. Where before when I quit drinking I was still stubbornly holding on to certain resentments and beliefs about how I was slighted, I have finally opened my eyes to how perceivably dangerous and scary my behavior is to other people especially women. \n\nI have lost a lot of friends many of whom I probably won't be able to make amends with for a very long time, but I have others who have stuck by me and who want to see me get better. Who believe me in despite how I acted. \n\nI am trying so fucking hard."}

When I was 23 my drinking started to escalate rapidly.  I approached my parents, doctor, and therapist about my alcohol use.  The decision was unanimous... that I didn't have an alcohol problem because I didn't meet a pre-requisite number of criteria to officially make it into the alcoholic club.\n\nI guess, for me, a better question is, Does alcohol fuck your shit up?  Because if I don't meet the pre-requisite criteria to be an alcoholic, then why shouldn't I just keep drinking?\n\nI think the Does alcohol fuck your shit up?  framework is a more effective evaluation tool than the black/whiteness of I'm or am I not an alcoholic.  \n\nEver wake up on Christmas Eve night not knowing where the hell you are with a rabbit bouncing around you?  \n\nEver wake up wondering who spilled water on you while you were asleep, and why this water smells kinda like piss?\n\nThose are some examples of questions that can help identify if alcohol fucks your shit up. \n\nIn the US, it's Memorial Day weekend.  This equals lots of alcohol.  I'm not going to lie, it'd be nice to sit out on someones back porch, about to eat an overcooked hotdog, while drinking a shitty lite beer.  The thought is better than the reality.   \n\nSo instead of asking yourself if you are or not an alcoholic, so you can rationalize having a drink, maybe try asking Does alcohol fuck your shit up?, and if that answer is yes, maybe skip that first drink.\n\nI'm not sure what this weekend will hold, but tonight I'm going to clean my kitchen because it's covered in honey from processing honey, give dog a bath, and watch a movie with my daughter.  \n\nWhat's everyone else doing tonight?"}

Even though I had to stop drinking because I was drinking too much too often and not because I was into health and fitness, I am personally interested in this culture because I believe it will relieve more people from the social pressures to drink. Maybe this culture has existed for a long time and I didn't know about it, but in the past, my experience with non-drinkers is that they had stopped drinking because it had been a problem, they didn't drink in light of religious beliefs, they didn't drink because they had alcoholics in their family history, or they didn't drink because they didn't like the feeling (and might prefer other substances). So this new, glamorous, sweaty, non-drinking health conscious culture is new to me.\n\nI don't really do Instagram, but I sometimes look at the account of Kayla Itsines, a very successful fitness entrepreneur. I remember from a New York Times profile of her that she did not drink alcohol, and today I wondered if she had said anything about that decision. I found that she posted this last year:\n\n&gt;kayla_itsines\u2b50\ufe0f\"Do you drink Alcohol?\"\u2b50\ufe0fThe simple answer to this is no, I don't. I have of course tried alcohol before, but it's just not something that interests me at all. I never really liked the taste, the way it made me feel, or any of the experiences I had associated with it. I have not had alcohol in 6 years (almost 7) and I probably will never drink it again. \nThis isn't me trying to raise myself up or make anyone feel bad for drinking it, it's just something that I have chosen for MY life. I have many clients that go out and have an occasional drink, Tobi will have a nice glass of wine with my dad at dinner sometimes, but I personally choose not to drink. I feel that I am a role model for a lot of young girls and I would love to show them that it's okay not to drink if you don't want to. I am proud to spread that message. You don't need to feel like you HAVE TO drink alcohol to fit in. You can still be social and have fun without it. \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI was kind of surprised to learn that she consciously views her example as reshaping a new kind of culture in which you don't have to drink to have fun. I find this very hopeful, especially for young women. In the past couple of decades, alcohol consumption in women has risen much more than men's consumption, as have alcohol-related emergency visits to the hospital among women. I also love that this particular non-drinking identity is bound up in notions of physical strength and empowerment rather than from weakness or a sense of deficiency. \n\nJust some thoughts on my 200th day on this journey.

On another show, one of the girls was so drunk she sat on her roommate's bed and peed. She said didn't remember doing it. Yep, blackout drunk. And there are so many bar fights, bad experiences and other alcohol related incidents on so many reality TV shows that totally mirror user experiences here at r/stopdrinking that I can only shake my head and say \"yep, alcoholics in the making showing all their fans how it's done.\" At least one guy on one show who was notorious for getting in trouble has cleaned up his act and openly admits his sobriety. Imagine a reality show where they take 8 party animals who have gone too far, and followed them through a summer of detox/rehab and avoiding situations where alcohol would do them in. Sadly, I don't think it would get good ratings."}

When I started drinking more with my boyfriend (now husband), alcohol became something exciting and new and feeling drunk or buzzed was fun. Eventually, if I drank, I would want to do it for the purpose of feeling the alcohol even if it was only three and it was usually when we were with other people who were also drinking or if my husband and I were at home having some beers. \n\nMy husband started telling me that I had a problem and for many reasons (he can be very controlling in many aspects of our life and it is stressful), I got tired of feeling like he was always monitoring (picking up my can to see how full it was, giving me looks if I drank too fast, asking how many I had, etc.) how much I drank and so I started to be secretive; like taking a beer from the back of the fridge or not letting him see that I was in my third beer instead of my first. Sometimes I even thought it was exciting to sectretly drink and I would buy two or four drinks at the store and drink them before I got out of the car at home. \n\nWhen I became pregnant, It was easy to not drink at all, but when I came home from the hospital, my mom had bought me a bottle of champagne to celebrate. I knew my husband would disapprove because we were already having issues with him being so controlling of every little thing that had to do with how I took care of the baby. But when my sisters came to visit, they wanted to open the bottle and I just wanted to have a glass to celebrate having a new baby and felt like it was ok since I had plenty of milk pumped to give him a bottle. But my husband got so mad and it made me feel like a trashy parent even though my sisters thought he was overreacting. \n\nThat is just one instance if how I feel that he was overreacting to something that other people have told me is no big deal. Since then, my secretive drinking gradually got worse as I did it more often and I know that that is a problem.\n\nI am just struggling with this whole thing because I don't like when he calls me an alcoholic (maybe I don't like the label) and other people have told me that my behavior (not the secretive drinking but drinking to feel the alcohol) is not alcoholism and they have told me that it is ok to want to drink and to sometimes get drunk. I don't know if I became a secretive drinker because my husband is super controlling or not, but I do know now that it is a problem and I don't want to ruin my family or my marriage. I would rather quit drinking than continue to have these fights with my husband and also to not let my drinking problem get worse which I am choosing to do, but I am frustrated because I feel invalidated that his controlling behavior had anything to do with it. However, I am not trying to find someone to blame for my behavior. \n\nIt will be hard during the moments when I am with family and friends and they are drinking and having fun and I will have to be sober because I just think it is fun. \n\n"}

Hope somebody can relate, and exchange some ideas. Please, don't ignore. Here it goes.\n\nI'm male, 23yo, and a cosinstent drinker, wich scares me a lot. I'm not exactly what society would see as an alcoholic. On my current stage, i drink only during weekends (6 ~ 12 cans of beer between every friday\\saturday, deppending if i'm alone or in company of my friend).\n\nThe thing is, it turned into a very strong (and bad) habit for me. It's a rule that my brain follows, on strict terms. \"Drink every friday\\saturday, don't drink during the week'. I can't even remember the last time i went trough a single weekend in my life without drinking (probably until 18yo).\n\nNow, i don't drink myself to blackout, but i sure feel the need to get that light buzz, otherwise, it just seems that i didn't rest during my weekend. \n\nHowever, i did have 2 experiences that make me ashamed, where i got drunk, vomitted, blacked out and got bathed by my fiancee. Did not had amnsesia, but lost control and vomitted all around the bathroom, so she needed to clean all the mess, bath me and put me in bed. She cryed alot, and suffered alot, because her deceased father used to be an tragic alcoholic, and i made her remember all the stress and struggle she experiencied with him. She almost broke up with me, and i felt terrible, because i remember how much she suffered from dealing with her alcoholic father. \n\nFirst time (2015), i promised her it would be the last. Then it happened a second time (2016), wich i promised it would be defenitely the last, and didn't blacked out since then.\n\nDuring those both occurrences, i was with friends, that instigated me altough i didn't see the black out coming. I always tought to be in control.\n\nOtherwise than that, i still drink (mostly beer, rarely vodka, rum, whiskey, but just a dose). My crack is for beer. I'm the beer guy, that praises a long neck.\n\nRecently, i'm getting more worried about that. In fact, i recently started to break, once in a while, the \"not drinking during the week\" rule. Sometimes, in the supermarket, i grab a can, have a sip while buying stuff. And that does not stopped me from drinking during the same weekend, also. \n\nAnd what scares me the most is that i have been making self-promises of not drinking during the weekend, and faillling miserably. I always end up having my 6~12 cans weekend experience, giving up from my promise, telling to myself that it's no problem, for i'm not binge drinking, for the fact that i've been productive during the week, and that things will never be out of control, because most of adult man have this habit without turning into an alcoholic.\n\nBut the thing is. I WANT to get rid of it, and i'm failling. So that's scary for me. Some people say that i should not worry, that it's just the regular social drinking. Some people say that i should worry, because if i want to stop, and fail everytime, than it's already an addiction.\n\nI know that most of you guys have way more experience in that path than those people, and way more experience than me.\n\nSo, could someone please give me some ideas? Should i look for medical help right now? Should i try to quit by myself, and COMMIT with it once and for all? Am i already an alcoholic?\n\nPlease help me, that question is just bothering me for the last days, and it's making me so nervous. I don't want to loose control, and i fear that if i continue on this path, things maybe would get serious after some years. Am i just being paranoid, os does my fears make sense?\n\nThank you all for reading the long text, and i'm sorry for the english mistakes. I wish you all an amazing day, and best of happines on your way to sobriety.\n"}

Once people start getting goofy, I head home, and am always glad I\u2019m home safe and sober. Mind you, this is very rare, I simply use this as an example of my will power during my recovery. \n\nRecently, a good friend said to me, \u201cafter one year, do you think you\u2019ll start moderating alcohol? You\u2019ll never know if you can if you don\u2019t try.\u201d I\u2019ve actually had several people ask me about moderation, as most people had no idea I had a drinking problem. I was very, very good at keeping it secret, so, most people don\u2019t think I actually ever had a problem. So, I don\u2019t get upset when my friends ask such questions.\n\nI, honestly, hadn\u2019t ever given it much thought. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t drink, so, being sober these last 300+ days has been relatively easy, and there\u2019s no alcohol in the house to tempt me.  It never really crosses my mind to have a drink, because I am so rarely around it. When I am around it, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not partaking, because I usually get flooded with my shameful memories. This makes it easy to go to bars, believe it or not. Kind of like, yeah, I\u2019m above that now. \n\nAnyway, since my friend mentioned moderation, I cannot get it out of my head. Thoughts of drinking have been flooding my head for days. I\u2019ve had several dreams about getting wasted on Jager, which was my drink of choice. Oddly, though, I am not craving hard liquor; I want a beer so. bad. Which is also odd because I drank hard liquor way more than I ever drank beer. However, I know if I had a beer, that would inevitably lead to shots. I know this because I never, ever just drank beer alone, and I\u2019m a creature of habit. \n\n So, last night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. My anxiety was high, and I could not stop thinking about having a drink. I kept going through my head all the reasons not to drink, but there was a voice saying, \u201cdon\u2019t rule out moderation.\u201d I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. I decided to distract myself with Reddit, and scrolled through the most recent page. There was a picture of a man that was five days sober, so, I went to read the comment section because I needed to see some uplifting comments about being sober. I finally found a thread that had this page linked. \n\nI haven\u2019t clicked on a subreddit link faster. \n\nI searched moderation, and you people are awesome. Every single thought I had, somebody else had. Some had experimented with the thoughts. And I saw exactly what I assumed. It. Can\u2019t. Work. \n\nThe best thing I saw on here was this: imagine justifying alcohol as if it were heroin. That hit me hard. My brother is two years sober from heroin, after years of struggling to get clean. I, foolishly, didn\u2019t even consider alcohol as dangerous as heroin because it\u2019s legal. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t just as harmful. \n\nI woke up this morning still craving alcohol, and I was disappointed in myself, because I had gone to bed on such a high note. I got on Facebook, and I had a new message. It was from a friend telling me he was seven days alcohol free. And I thought that was something special. Then he said his problem was dealing with boredom. I told him to stop being so boring, and go do something. Then it hit me. Go do something, you goof. So, I played five hours of LEGO Star Wars. \n\nDuring this time, I talked to my fianc\u00e9 about my cravings and moderation. I told him all the advice you all had and how inspiring it was. He was getting excited for me, which got me excited. He doesn\u2019t drink, and for two years, was the only person who knew the extent of my drinking. He begged me to quit all the time, but he never left me. I was an alcoholic when we met, and all he\u2019s ever cared about is getting me to be the best BobbyKingOfHearts that I can be. We both agreed that moderation is a joke, and there\u2019s no point in even trying because I\u2019m just setting myself up for failure. The best part was that he didn\u2019t judge me for wanting to try it out, but rather, worked out with me why I was considering it, and helped weigh my options. I am grateful for having a support system. \n\nI am so glad I found this subreddit, and am grateful for people like y\u2019all. I now have a second support system. \n\nIWNDWYT"}

Like many of us it has been a miraculous and unbelievable feat. One I can't explain through self knowledge or reason alone. That's because self-reliance and self-knowledge yielded me nothing for so long. In fact, the more I seemingly treated my drinking, the more my drinking progressed.\n\nThat was until I was introduced to a program of action, a design for living, that I rejected for many years. Between SD and the program and fellowship of AA, I've not only found physical sobriety, but am also discovering more and more each day, an emotional sobriety; soundness of mind. This has unshackled my consciousness and freed me from a life of increasing misery and despair, to one of hope and fun and love.\n\nAs the quote below states better than I ever could, I've stop setting expectations for life. Instead I try to seek life's expectations for me. As they say in AA, you can't think your way into right living, but you can live your way into right thinking.\n\n\"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\u2014daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\" - Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning\n\nThanks for striving to meet those expectations right now. I won't drink with you today!"}

I have to stop my unhealthy type drinking, ie drinking alone, out of feelings, etc. I have been told I can \u201chave a beer or a glass of wine if I\u2019m out with friends or family for dinner, or for a special occasion, etc.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m \u201cabout\u201d a week in. I had a beer on Tuesday when I hadn\u2019t made the decision to stop drinking, but I was just dipping my toe in to just not drinking if I didn\u2019t feel like it. \n\nMy Tuesday beer was so unrewarding and it was one that I drank because I thought it would be good in theory, in practice it wasn\u2019t that good and I threw out the other half (I don\u2019t know how much it was, it was a can, but felt about half) then I just decided that I had started my time the Sunday before and I just needed to keep going. In the long run, I don\u2019t think it matters if it was Sunday or Wednesday, but in the beginning it doesn\u2019t matter to me, and I\u2019m just moving forward.\n\nWine is my drink of choice- I\u2019m going to miss it.

{"author": "CaliCardsFan", "creation_date": "2018-05-19 04:32:41", "selftext": "So, recently I have decided that I need to quit drinking due to medical reasons which I won't go to in this post.  Let me just say that alcohol has never really been a problem with me in the usual sense that it is for what one thinks of as an \"alcoholic\".  I have never lost a job, ruined relationships, ruined other aspects of my life as a drinker or anything of that nature.  I can go periods of time without drinking, and am able to restrain myself from drinking in excess when I absolutely need to.\n\nHowever, the main reason I am dreading the idea of quitting is the comfort alcohol provides me in social situations.  This can be at parties, receptions and events where small talk with strangers is expected and my social anxiety/introverted tendencies tend to be more heightened.  Alcohol definitely makes that more bearable and makes me more able to participate and feel engaged in the conversations that I would ordinarily not have much to contribute to or care about.\n\nIn addition, drinking is a past time that I has made it easier to make friends and interact with them throughout my adult life.  This includes college where I lived in a fraternity house for three years.  This also includes get together with old friends I don't see anymore but there is always drinking to help bring us together and make our time together more enjoyable.  Hell, without \"liquid courage\", I would have never had the courage to ask out my now wife.  \n\nWithout drinking, I just find social occasions a lot more unbearable.  I don't want to quit drinking, but as I said above, I need to for health reasons.  I wanted to know if anyone else has had similar experiences as I have had who has social anxiety, and if so, are there any strategies that you might recommend?  Thanks!"}

A little background: I\u2019ve posted in here and on /cutdowndrinking before. I have a problem with drinking too much white wine during the month - I.e. can\u2019t stop after one or two. I also have occasional black outs because of this. I don\u2019t drink alone or during the week. Regardless of all that, I know this is not healthy, it scares me at times, and I want to take steps to change that/stop completely. I saw a counselor yesterday in hopes of starting that process. She began our appt asking me why I was there and I said something to the effect of \u201cwell I have trouble with moderation and drinking too much, at times to the point of blacking out.\u201d And she cut me off immediately with \u201cso you\u2019re an alcoholic.\u201d I was pretty taken aback that she felt confident in diagnosing me after I gave her maybe three sentences-worth of information. I tried to rebut with \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what I am. I just know I have a problem with drinking and want to fix that.\u201d And she came back with \u201cwell one of the definitions of an alcoholic is that you can\u2019t stop once you start. A lot of times it\u2019s just in your genes. That\u2019s all.\u201d I went on to say how the label stigmatizes people and (I\u2019ve read some Annie grace before) that while you can quit something like cigarettes without the raising of an eyebrow, you get labeled (like she labeled me) an alcoholic when you say you don\u2019t drink. She didn\u2019t really seem to comprehend that this was anything to really be concerned about because she then said \u201cwell you don\u2019t have to tell people you\u2019re an alcoholic, you just say it doesn\u2019t make you feel good.\u201d The appointment basically went down hill from there (she also asked me if I was religious and when I said no, told me I need to think about something because kids need religion.

Didn't ever get drunk unless I pounded them. I read mixed things online about it. I figured I would be better off mentally if I considered myself an alcoholic..the thing I never wanted to be.\n\nI've been struggling with really bad acid reflux for a few years now. That is magically gone. I haven't taken any Tums in 6 days.\n\nI used to have BMs like 5 times a day. Now its only 1 or 2.\n\nI quit drinking the other night because I had some realization after I finished my 4th tall boy that there was no reason for me to be drinking. I kept asking myself why I felt the need. \n\nI also take depression medication which specifically says on the back to \"not drink any alcohol.\" So I don't even think my medication has been working correctly.\n\nAlcoholism is pretty bad in my family. My dad broke that cycle though. His dad actually drank himself to death.\n\nWhy did I drink? Well stress probably. I liked the way it made me feel numb to the world after coming home from work.

Left that treatment center to drink the first night out. Then I moved towns and cocaine wasn't easy to find. I would come home after work and drink a 26er (750ml) of vodka by myself, pass out and wake up and puke a little bit..... Amazingly I actually thought I was doing good because I wasn't doing coke. My alcoholism progressed and I discovered the morning drink which was the death of me. I would drink the morning drink, trigger my allergy and keep drinking. In the end, after 20 yrs of hardcore drinking I had progressed to drinking around the clock, 4 or 5 day blackouts and I kept ending up on the hospital for medical detox as I was scared I would get seizures and die... It happens!.. Another treatment center only to drink the first day I got out again. In and out of AA for years, coming back over 30 times!... I was a hopeless alcoholic. I did want to drink but I couldn't imagine a life without it. How would I have the confidence to pick up women? To hang out with friends and be funny and the life of the party? How would I live life?

I first touched alcohol at 18, first drank \"alcoholically\" at 21, first tried to stop at 23. Now 25 and six months sober.\n\nI was surprised at how hard it was to stop in the beginning. I went to a 30 day rehab in 2016 because I could not give up alcohol for more than two weeks. I didn't want to stop fully for myself, but I didn't want to continue drinking either. In November I vowed to make it six months telling myself I have to quit eventually, and it won't get any easier the longer I wait. I do feel better today than I did 6 months ago, though not by much. I no longer have agonizing nights where I'd absolutely drink for relief if I had the opportunity, and I can enjoy movies sober now (that took a while to come back). \n\nI know I'm not the only person to not feel on top of the world at six months, but I am frustrated with how unhappy I am. I have moderate levels of depression and anxiety (ie not suicidal and no panic attacks) and while they were a lot worse when I was drinking every day (yes panic attacks), the difference of 3 months sober to 6 months has been nil. And that's because this is how I was before I ever touched alcohol - it shouldn't be a surprise. I am in therapy, and that has helped a lot with how I behave with my anxiety. I haven't found much to help with the depression. I have been taking and changing meds since 2016, and for whatever reason the [SSND]RIs don't affect me.\n\nI can't make the same six month commitment to make it a year that I made to get here. I get urges to drink occasionally, but telling myself to hold out until [next month, 1 year, tomorrow] won't work just by itself anymore because I can't see why that matters emotionally (I know an extra six months without alcohol would be a very good thing for me). I'm going to a meeting tonight, and I have therapy tomorrow. I could just use some perspective that maybe helps with my cynicism. I hope to feel better at a year but you know I've been told that about 6 months at 3 months and 3 months at 1 month. \n\nOr does anyone have advice on how you motivate yourself? Even with simple stuff - like I'm trying to meditate regularly, but I have trouble doing it for more then 5 minutes unless I am already very relaxed, and I just don't know how to motivate myself when there are no positive consequences (at least at first - those 5 minutes of fidgety meditating can only do so much), and no perceived negative consequences.

A month later after watching a Dodger VS Giants game and having a couple beers I received another DUI for being too close to a cop on the highway.

I am a chemistry major and will continue my education despite my fall backs but would you call me an alcoholic?

I was once having a conversation with a person active in AA and he said some folks say if you can go spend $20 in a bar and then go home, you aren\u2019t an alcoholic.

I had physical withdrawal symptoms after my second drink(stomach issues, sweating, shaking), but not any burning craving for alcohol. So, I went to a couple AA meetings decided it wasn't for me and left after 2 or 3 meetings. I stayed sober for about 4 months until New Year's Day, when I had a little wine with dinner to celebrate. I stopped drinking again for about 5 months this time(until a couple days ago). This time I could barely get buzzed after downing half a bottle of Whiskey. Keep in mind I haven't been drinking this entire time, and haven't ever had enough to drink to generate any kind of immunity. I wonder if this is genetic and if I should stay away from alcohol indefinitely."}

I have family that do not like when I was drinking but I have come to the realization I need to do this for me.  I need to do this for me because if I do not stop, I will be no use in the future to anyone.  I asked myself what exactly was I thinking on my last binge.  I think I know now.  I watched a video, I forgot who, but they explained how some types of alcoholics react to alcohol the way I do and it made so much sense.  I drink to get \"energy\" but when the energy wears off I feel hungover ~ 20 minutes later.  I drink again and get another boost and another and another.  After each drink or shot, I feel good for a few minutes.  It wears off so I do it again.  This is the same as being addicted to Heroin.  It works basically the same as explained but I have never tried it so I don't know. My type of alcoholic is very dangerous as I would drink until I blacked out and sometimes that was enough to stay in my system for a long long time.  I am ready because I am tired of the fogginess in my work, I am tired of all the body pain and I am tired of all the other symptoms.

But to continue not to drink requires additional choices, just as important as the first to stop drinking. One of the other critical decisions is how to recover and then maintain our bodily health. Reconciling the body to health needs to be at least 30% of our daily focus. Mental, emotional, spiritual and material development is undoubtedly critical as well - but I really think it's smart to start with our bodies. It all comes down to food and fitness. I personally believe you can eat your mental and physical recovery from alcohol. There are several methods to addressing food but it all comes down to minimizing gluten and sugar and drinking water. Lots of water. We not only need to flush-out the toxins that are a result of continued alcohol abuse, but also wash-out the new toxins we inadvertently take in daily. Let's start there. \n\nLet's drink as much water daily that we drank in alcohol weekly. Good rule of thumb. "}

I imagined that as sobriety continued, everything would just keep steadily improving. \n\nBut what happened is that these benefits eventually leveled off: I stopped losing weight, and the other changes in my life became the new \"normal.\" I no longer reveled in not having hangovers because, frankly, I couldn't really remember what they felt like.

For most of my life, I'd always been too obsessed with how I measured up to others and felt that my life would be better if only I were a little fitter, a little thinner, and a little richer.

You people are an inspiration, and I've enjoyed reading posts here.\n\nDrinking for me has been the catalyst to basically every bad decision I've made in life. I've been arrested, spent the night in the drunk tank, broken bones, broken relationships, burned through money going to the bars, got a beer belly, etc. When I look back at my life, I've now come to the conclusion drinking has been the cause of my failure to become who I wanted to be. It's almost like a midlife crisis, where I look at myself, and wonder what happened, and now it's clear, alcohol happened, and prevented me from achieving what I thought I would have by my age.\n\nIt snowballs, and compounds problems. I wake up groggy or hungover after going to bed late, and not sleeping well, go to work and pay for lunch because I was too drunk to make it the night before. Spend money in the cafe, then leave work, and go spend more money at the bar. I stay there for hours to the point I have drunken munchies and spend more money on unhealthy fast food for dinner, on top of all the empty calories I drank in alcohol. Then I continue to drink at home, my place is in disarray because I don't take the time to clean it up, and then repeat. \n\nDrinking leads to an unhealthy physical and mental lifestyle, and an expensive one that prevents you from saving for the future, because you are always living for that drink in the present. It's to the point I don't have much to show after 15 years of drinking every day.\n\nWell that's all coming to an end, because I've now made the decision this drinking has to end, and I've already seen results. I go to the gym to exercise instead of the bar after work. I make my own breakfast, lunch and dinner. I can wake up early on Saturday not hungover, and go to the gym, and then have the energy to start being productive, and taking care of things I've let go, like simply cleaning my room, organizing my closet, doing errands etc. Without the drinking holding me back, I have time to grow, and learn new skills, get healthier, save money.\n\nWhat really helped me is [myfitnesspal.com](https://myfitnesspal.com) which I'm using to track my foods, and also my drinking. Came to the point that to lose the weight I had to really cut back on the drinks due to the empty calories. Kind of forced me to wake up to what I knew I should be doing all along. This isn't a commercial for that website, but it's what I'm using to track my drinking, exercise, and food. Love it.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to speak my mind, and maybe help motivate others, like you have motivated me to better myself without alcohol. Now that I'm more sober \\(still drink, but a lot less\\), I see how much time I've wasted being drunk. Finally getting my life back, and it was an eye opening experience.\n\nS.O.B.E.R. is an acronym for Son Ofa Bitch Everything's Real. That's what the nurse told me when I sobered up in the drunk tank 15 years ago and realized what I had done. It was bad, still have the scar from that night."}

I started working out regularly starting from January of this year. And I\u2019ve quit drinking as of April of this year. I drank heavily over the last 12 years \\(about half a dozen hard drinks during the day followed by 2 bottles of red wine each and every night\\). I drank moderately in the 15 years prior to that \\(beer and wine\\). I drank a lot when I was in the Army \\(12 pack of beer when I could afford it\\).\n\nNone of my habits were stopped cold turkey. The habits have weighed heavily on my mind over the years. In the months prior to giving up caffeine, I didn\u2019t drink as much coffee until, one day, I just stopped. Quitting cigarettes was similar. I would go outside to smoke less and less and, when I did smoke, half the time I was inhaling into my lungs and the other half into just my mouth. After a while, I was simply inhaling into my mouth then blowing the smoke out. Then I stopped.\n\nA similar pattern has been happening over the last weeks with my drinking. I\u2019ve wanted to quit for a while. I started drinking less and less. I realized I felt fine in the evenings when I didn\u2019t drink so much. I started subbing tea for wine as something to have in my hand through the night. Two weeks ago, I went 3 days without drinking. The next 2 days, I drank but not as much as I used to. Then I stopped. I made it through a weekend without drinking \\(Fridays and Saturdays were my heaviest drinking days\\); that was a BIG milestone for me. I\u2019m going to keep going. Next milestone is 2 weeks of no drinking, then a month, then 2 months and so on. One day at a time.\n\nI started taking ZzzQuil to help me sleep at night when I stopped drinking regularly.

Daily I was ending up blackout drunk, usually stopping by the liquor store after work (i got cash tips every day at my work). I got so good at it that if I were at a bar, my body was pretty much trained to where I could walk straight and confidently, and order a drink with a clear voice. Even when I was arrested, when I was in the police station and was getting my BAC taken, the officer asked if I had a high tolerance. I said I believe so, and he said \"yeah, because most people at this level can barely put together a sentence, and you sound crystal clear. Shit, I might not have even suspected you were drunk.\" (I was at 0.18). \nAnyway, cut to now. I occasionally give in but it's rare, and I've been a few weeks without drinking.  But man, I never realized how much alcohol is in the media until I wasn't drinking. \nToday, I'm watching a video of one of my favorite YouTube personalities, who always has a whiskey in hand when discussing music. Man, that makes me crave one. Whiskey was my go-to. Fucking LOVE whiskey. The taste, the way it goes with a cigarette, the warmth going down the gullet. Ahem, excuse me, got a bit distracted there...\n\"Okay\", I think, \"I'll play a video game, distract me from wanting to drink.\" So I put on my all-time favorite game, Red Dead Redemption. Kickass Western, I get lost in it for HOURS. Should get my mind off the cravings, right? \nTotally forgot about the saloons, it seems, and I find myself ordering my character shots of whiskey, almost to live vicariously through him. Kind of sad, in a way. \nWell, don't drink and... drive a wagon, I suppose.\nI never even thought about it until I was trying not to drink, but damn, alcohol is EVERYWHERE in media, and nothing makes you want a drink like watching someone else drink.

I dated party boys and wondered why nice guys with careers and the desire for a family life weren\u2019t interested in me. \n\nMy excessive consumption of alcohol kept me from setting and keeping financial goals.

I'm 22 now, and from the 19-21 I would drink most days, usually alone, far too much, and found it difficult to stop drinking once I'd started, and to go days without drinking. I've managed to mostly pull myself out of it and I'm much better than I was, although once I hit the one month mark of sobriety I always feel compelled to drink again. I guess in essence what I'm doing is regulating, never drinking more than once a month, when I do drink I now find it easy not to drink the next day, I remember how shitty it makes me feel, I don't want to wake up to that unpleasantness or do anything I'll regret. Despite being much better though, I just don't feel like I've truly kicked the stuff. Even if it is very controlled (for now) and I don't see that changing anytime soon, I just can't stay 100% sober.

It took months for my family to realize I wasn't drinking.  Many of them expressed curiosity and offered admiration but didn't really push the matter.  I just played it cool.  I didn't want things to be a big deal.  I didn't want people to act differently around me.  And they don't.  I prefer it like that.  \n\nIt still surprised me when my mother invited me to a beer tasting party.  She drinks about 1 drink a month. She picked up a mixed half rack of micro brewery beer and invited a dozen or so people over to sample the various flavors.  She asked me today if I wanted to come.  I just said, \"no, not really\" and left it at that.  She didn't say anything else about it and didn't act hurt, so I feel like it's all good.  I'm happy to be invited to things, that I'm not skipped over just because I don't drink.  Wait, does she really know that I don't drink ever?  Maybe it doesn't really matter if she does know.  It's kind of a non-issue.  I don't care if she never drinks pineapple juice.  So, it's cool. \n\nI just am surprised at how casual it is.  I thought for many years that the only way people stopped drinking was dramatic and their lives would never be the same and they couldn't do anything.  People would talk about them and whisper and avoid inviting them to parties and try and be overly nice but then shun them in reality.  It's kind of laughable.  I'm going to friend's epic BBQ party this weekend.  It'll be great.  There will be drunks stumbling around being wild, but I won't be one of them.  I'll be the one kicking it in the hammock, or helping out with some dishes, or cooking breakfast the next day for those who aren't too hungover.  \n\nSorry this is long and rambling.  I just wanted to say that being a nondrinker and sober person can be much more than my preconceived notion of how I thought it had to be.

I've already seen a huge reduction in my drinking levels and have hope for the first time in as many years. \n\nThis past weekend I spent two days camping with my buddies. No wives to nag us about drinking too much, or kids to be responsible for. Just 6 guys in the forest with lots and lots of liquor and beer. You'd think I would get tore up? Yeah me too, but this time I took my Naltrexone!\n\nThe first night I had 4 beers and a couple of group shots over 8 HOURS (5pm-1am). Normally I would have been blackout drunk by 11pm (8+ beers and lots of liquor). Instead I practiced mindful drinking, got pleasantly buzzed, and probably drank 2 gallons of water haha. I still had loads of fun and felt freaking great the next morning (can't say the same for some of my buddies). \n\nThe next day was tougher to drink mindfully. We played Baseball Beer Pong, which btw is awesome, but involves chugging half beers and drinking consistently through the game. So I had a harder time tracking my beers. However, even after getting to the point where I'd previously be ramping up the drinks, I still never felt that pull to get drunk. I was even dubbed the \"den mother\" because I kept reminding everyone to drink water. Again, I had a blast even without getting drunk. In fact, I'd say I had even MORE fun than usual as I didn't have to worry about getting my next drink or whether there'd be enough booze left to satisfy the beast. \n\nI've been doing TSM for a few weeks now and this was definitely the ultimate test. I had every opportunity to get as drunk as I wanted and never even came close. I had even wanted to postpone starting TSM until after this guys trip because I felt that I \"wouldn't enjoy it\" without being able to get wasted. In reality, TSM helped make this trip more fun and reinforces that this method is changing my life for the better, one little pill at a time!"}

I used to run around 30 miles a week before I decided I cared more about drinking than I did about fitness. Binge eating and drinking went hand-in-hand for me. \n\nThe weight doesn't come off over night, but for the first time my clothes are getting looser and looser while I'm eating candy and ice cream like it's Treat Yo' Self 2018. I'm starting to get more serious about my diet and exercise (because I know it will make me happy), but for now I am letting myself enjoy my short *very* slow jogs followed by whatever snack I want. Whatever keeps me sober!!\n\nGetting sober is the best gift I have ever given myself. After multiple legal problems, crashing my vehicle, and fucking up all my relationships I didn't think there was hope for me: I was ashamed of myself. I don't feel that way any more. Even at 50 days in, I feel so damn hopeful about the future, even if it's a little scary. \n\nIf you're struggling, earnestly reach out for help and you will receive it. I personally have chosen AA, and I go every day. Being sober is so much easier when you're not doing it on your own. In AA, I've met an amazing community of people who I now call friends and feel more loved than I ever had.

I have been attempting to quit for some time now, over the past couple of years I've had a serious of months of stopping followed weeks of binging.

Its not until I over do it and end up making a fool of myself that I realize I really need to stop. My previous streak of sobriety was around 100 days, from new years day to mid april. I had my last drink may 7th and not gonna lie it does get easier to stop this time around. Im really writing this post as a reminder to myself and to everyone else out there attemting to quit to not fall for the illusion of moderation for some of us it can be a slippery slope.

Not even a sip of beer, and refused marijuana at several points. On the 6th day, I had a really strange dream. It involved my ex and lots of partying, and I woke up feeling like shit. I had this fucked up feeling of really needing something to relax, and I ended up drinking a beer. Then two. Then at night 3 more beers. I stopped there, and ended up smoking weed with a friend. Deep down I already knew that my sober streak was over. Yesterday I got crazy drunk, let another drunk friend drive my car at 7am and we bought more weed from a complete stranger who ended up going with us in the car. I have a Huge hangover today, and honestly I would do it all again. Those 5 days sober felt good, but not optimal. I felt dead inside, frustrated, overanalytical of my own thoughts and actions, bored, sad, and lonely. So very lonely. I realized that that's what I'm running away from with booze. When I'm drunk, everything is a possibility: I mighht spend the night with that girl, or that, or that other one, but the reality is that the odds of that happening are low, and regret usually comes the next morning. I spend copious amounts of money when I go out. \n\nAnyway, today I had the opportunity to go out with some friends again. I wont do it. I'd get very drunk again. It would happen on saturday, too.

{"author": "ponderingpeony", "creation_date": "2018-05-16 20:25:59", "selftext": "[Before &amp; After!!](https://imgur.com/gallery/2cIgVxN)\n\nWords cannot describe how insurmountable getting to a year sober seemed only 365 short days ago. On May 15th, 2017, I was so scared to stop drinking that I took a Xanax to calm my nerves. On May 16th, I awoke sober, ready to confront my vices and commit to giving sobriety a whole-hearted attempt. I had NO idea what was in store. The first week I had two full blown panic attacks, but I did not drink or smoke or pop a pill to escape it. I sat and cried and hyperventilated until the worst was over. I had felt my feelings to their full extent and survived?!? That was new for me. \n\nA few weeks later, I dumped my open bottles down the drain, flushed my stash, and gave everything else away. I started putting more obstacles between myself and the first drink. At first I didn\u2019t really understand why *I* had to be sober. I hated being 24 and unable to party \u201cnormally\u201d like everyone else. Why did I always have to take things too far? Why did I want to escape myself so badly? Why didn\u2019t I care about myself or what could happen to me? Why me?? \n\nI made a list of things I will never have to experience again by not drinking. No more hangovers, no more waking up in strangers beds, no more ruined friendships, no more driving drunk, no more mixing drugs/alcohol... I rattled off two pages worth of \u2018never agains\u2019 and would refer back to it if I had a craving. \n\nFinally around 60 days sober things started to click. I realized I didn\u2019t *have* to be sober, I get to *choose* to be sober. I get to experience the full spectrum of life. I get to do the deep work on myself. I get to feel all of my feelings and notice all of life\u2019s miracles, things I never felt or noticed before, but were there all along. Trudging through the motions of life was no longer an option. Some days were better than others, but honestly my worst day sober will always truly be better than my \u201cbest\u201d day drinking/drugging. \n\nOne of the most surprising things of early sobriety was hearing stories of nights out from my friends where they\u2019d recall me being passed out or like I wasn\u2019t even there, when my memories are of me being social and fun. Weird right? There were times in the early days when I would look in the mirror and barely recognize myself. I was slowly unbecoming everything I wasn\u2019t, yet not fully stepped back into myself. \n\nEach day has started with the same promise to myself. I promise to do whatever it takes to stay sober today. Some days were easier than others. Some days I\u2019d eat ice cream and go to bed at 8pm. Other days I\u2019d be at a music festival and think \u201cno one would even care if you drank right now\u201d, except I realized that in fact, I cared. I cared about myself now. I couldn\u2019t escape my own actions anymore. I used to joke that my moral compass was broken, when in fact it was there all along. I can no longer act recklessly, cheat, steal or lie, because I have to live with myself full well knowing exactly what I am doing. Before it didn\u2019t matter what I did because there was always an exit strategy, an escape route away from myself. When that stopped working, I was forced to figure something else out. That something else has been kindness and compassion towards myself and others. To practice mindfulness, gratitude, love and care. \n\nSobriety has allowed me to get into the drivers seat of my life and take control of my future. Stopping self medicating was only the beginning to so many other changes internal and external. Everything inside me is different. The way I view the world, myself, my circumstances, my past, present and future is through a lens of love and acceptance. I never thought in a million years sobriety would ever be for me. I loved my vices like I love my closest friends, but sometimes when you close one door, a world full of opportunity is waiting for you. I know this year has set the foundation for a long, healthy and beautiful life ahead of me. Sobriety is the gift that I give myself daily, and the gift that truly keeps on giving. \n\nIf you\u2019re just starting off fighting the good fight, KEEP GOING. Even if you slip and fall, brush yourself off, figure out what you\u2019ve learned and carry the fuck on, warrior! We choose to live the way others won\u2019t, so that we can live the way that other can\u2019t. And that is living a life full of intention, purpose, passion, creativity, love and kindness. The world needs more people who are awakened in their lives. I love you SD. Without all of your stories and vulnerability I would not be here writing these words today. Thank you for being here and showing me that I am worth it, and that I\u2019ll never be alone in this journey. Here\u2019s to the next 365. \u263a\ufe0f"}

Figured I would throw it up here now that the holiday weekend is almost over, just to stay on the wagon, so to speak. Hope you're all enjoying your weekend!\n\nAll of this still feels so weird, in a way. I'm only 30 days in, which is a drop in the bucket compared to a great many folks here, so I don't even necessarily feel \"proud\" of it. I just wanted to get my thoughts and observations out there.\n\nWhen I first posted here, I didn't even have a plan to go 30 days. Hell, I wasn't even sure I could make it a week. Well, I did and it's just still so strange to me. I almost don't want alcohol anymore. I don't really crave it and when I do, I find that I crave the associations that I've built up over the years. Going to shows and drinking, having friends over and drinking, weekend drinking and so forth. I don't miss the drink itself, because somehow over the past 30 days \\(I think SD and the books I've listened to are responsible for this\\) I have realized alcohol has never given me anything and will continue to take everything from me. I am better off without it.\n\nThat just still seems so unreal to me. I read posts on here where people are 3 months in, 6 months in, 1 year in...and having cravings, or even finding themselves in a situation where they have a drink. I keep being afraid that will be me. I keep telling myself there's no way it can be this easy, that the cravings and the pain will eventually come. I just can't believe I'm at this point. This is the longest I've went without drinking in 12 years and I just didn't expect that I would be able to take this hardline attitude of \"no alcohol\". It wasn't even a thought in my mind 30 days ago. It scared the shit out of me to even consider.\n\nRegardless, the past 30 days haven't been easy. I'm still learning to experience situations without alcohol. Last night I went to a bar to watch a friend of mine play music. It was my first bar/venue experience since stopping and it was fine...I didn't desire alcohol, I just felt awkward and a bit anxious because I didn't know what to do. I realize I'll have to experience those things to retrain my brain to live without alcohol.\n\nI've had some rough days where I've felt very emotional and sad and frustrated for no apparent reason. I try to reflect in these moments and just let myself feel what I do. I know that I am still learning to actually feel my emotions, good and bad, without numbing my mind with a drink. That said, those days and moments are becoming fewer and in the past week...the opposite has happened, I've felt strangely happy and optimistic for no apparent reason.\n\nI have also observed very odd reactions from people who I've told about my endeavor. Most have been supportive, but I also find they start to justify to me their own alcohol use? I mean, I make it clear I am not on some high horse about it. I fully support people doing what they want and this is a choice I made for me. I've read about this many times, it's just interesting to see in person. I also have to admit that sometimes it makes me feel like an outcast and a bit lonely.\n\nI've also been wondering if this is the start of a much broader change in my life. Part of me desires new friendships that don't begin with alcohol, because I have this fear that some of my existing ones are rather hollow without it. I feel like I need to pick up a new habit or hobby or something. I just feel like I'm learning to live all over again, which I guess is exciting and scary at the same time.\n\nAll of that said...I feel so thankful that I escaped the grip that alcohol had one me. Like unbelievably thankful, almost to the point where I feel very emotional about it when I think about it too hard.\n\nMy next goal is another 30 days. If I make that, I will be 62 days sober on the 1 year anniversary of my father's death from alcohol.  I want to believe he would be more proud of me for that than anything else I could do.\n\nThank you all for being here. You've given me something I was unable to give myself and I am eternally grateful for that."}

{"author": "mardeka", "creation_date": "2018-05-06 16:45:18", "selftext": "Hi!\n\nSo some backstory: I quit drinking one month ago (30 days sober as of today). I would say that I was a functioning alcoholic. I mean that in the way that I wouldn't drink every day or get black out drunk. But I did drink about 4/5 days a week, mostly wine and beer, and when I drank I couldn't stop at just one glass of wine or one beer. I would also often drink alone. So I am aware that I am not one of those people who can drink occasionally a glass of wine. When I drank I always craved more. So I quit drinking a month ago, haven't had any withdrawal symptoms, but I do crave alcohol from time to time. \n Also about a month ago I met a new guy, and we have been on several dates so far, and talked about being exclusive and both wanting a serious relationship. I wouldn't say I am in love with him, but I do like him a lot and look forward to what may come out of it. The problem is I knew his mother died 3 years ago (he is 30, I am 29), but recently he told me that she died of alcoholism. She had been an alcoholic his whole life and because of it during part of his childhood he lived with his grandmother. She also had been in and out rehab, tried to quit several times, etc. the whole story. Moreover, he never met his father, so despite all this, his relationship with his mother was quite close.\nSo, since I have just met him and I didn't want to scare him away, I haven't told him yet about my problems with alcohol. Now I am even more afraid that knowing my struggle with alcoholism will scare him away, but at the same time I feel that it is unfair to keep it a secret from him, given his past. I feel like I should tell him, because I feel like, given his mother's story, we would not want to get involved with someone like me. \n\nSo my question is: what would you do if you were in my place? Would you tell him right away in case he didn't want to pursue a relationship with someone like me? or would you wait to see how things go?\n\ntldr; I quit drinking a month ago, my new boyfriend (been dating for one month) just told me his mother died of alcoholism. Have not told him yet about my struggle with alcohol. Not sure if I should tell him now or wait."}

It\u2019s been really tough because I\u2019ve been fighting this battle with alcohol for years. I\u2019m only 24, a female, so most people would ask how is it that alcohol had become such a problem for me so young. Well, at first it was just for fun, then it turned into me acting crazy, doing stupid embarrassing things, drunk binges, forgetting almost every night out, hiding bottles in my room/bathroom, becoming a full blown alcoholic. To be honest, I got to that point bc I refused to come to terms with how trashy I felt. I couldn\u2019t even go anywhere for fun without alcohol. I would keep small bottles on me. Alcohol ruined a 3.5 yr relationship for me, several friendships, jobs, and it tainted my image severely. Alcohol became a part of my identity, and alcohol was taking down my life FAST. I made it the center of my world, and I knew it deep down but I preferred to drown reality in alcohol. I\u2019ve been subscribed to r/stopdrinking since December, reading people\u2019s posts, resetting my badge after days, relapsed over and over, but I always got back up and tried again because it\u2019s better to try than give up altogether. Do not accept defeat. Keep fighting. I\u2019ve tried to be that person that has a few glasses of wine, then it turns into two bottles. Then I would turn to drug use so I could drink even more, and repeat the destructive cycle. I made a decision on May 5th that I would make the decision to give up alcohol because the failed experiments were never going to change. I would look around at the people my age who have already finished school, stayed in relationships, getting married and having kids, buying houses, all that great normal people stuff and I wanted it so badly because I wanted to have something to feel accomplished about. I feel like I had nothing. Now I\u2019m eating healthy, working out everyday, waking up early, reading books, and even getting creative with cooking (I love cooking), and I slowly feel like the real me before I started drinking heavily is starting to come back. Before I started drinking, that was the real me, someone who could live life to the fullest and someone who was genuinely happy. The mess I was 24 days ago, hasn\u2019t came back and the benefits of life without alcohol outweigh anything alcohol has to offer to me (a shitty life). The real me is a fighter, a person with conviction, and a big heart. I will not let alcohol dull my shine anymore. If you\u2019re struggling, don\u2019t give up. Take it a day at a time and don\u2019t accept defeat. #IWNDWYT "}

Mostly, because when I do that, it seems more fun. And most likely, it is. It's easier to have fun when you have some blinders on, right? Alcohol has been my savior. I found that many of my social anxieties vanished when I had a few in me. I made many new friends this way. I am still friends with them. In many ways, alcohol cured me of my inhibitions. So much so, actually, that I really am quite capable going out, being sober, and chatting it up. Yet, for some reason, as I continue my drinking, I find I am drinking more and more. I think that is how the chemical works, you need more and more to have the \"good\" effects. Damn, isn't there a better drug out there? What is hurting me, as I need more of the drug for the same effect, I find the next day harder more difficult.  To put it quite simply, alcohol in the beginning helped me... So much so that I was able to do things, even sober, that I had a hard time doing before. But now, it is becoming a detriment to my life.\n\nAnyway, as I find that any drug can be helpful at first, the increasing dosage and the increasing after effects start to catch up with you.\n\nAnyway, this is kind of rambling and incoherent. What I am asking is my next step. I would like to go out to the local bar and grill, watch a game, chat it up. It would be great to go see a comedy show, and just have non-alcoholic drinks. In fact, I have done this before, with no detriment to my life. A couple of NA beers and a bit of creative trickery, and I was just having as much fun as if I had had the real stuff.\n\nMy goal is to live my life I did before, but replace any alcoholic drink with either a NA beer, or a non-alcohlic drink. Has this worked for anyone here, I think it is quite doable. I say that, because I have actually done it for months at a time, between my stupidity and re-addiction. \n\nI apologize for long rambling here, I was just trying to give my impressions without too much thinking back to edit it."}

The song is \u201cWhiskey Without Women\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve always felt this way about alcohol and other mind altering substances. Of course I did things when I was drunk that I wouldn\u2019t have done sober, but it wasn\u2019t the bottle\u2019s fault. Ever. Clearly I had it in me to do whatever it is I did, I just needed the inhibition to go away.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about this again because a famous actress got in trouble yesterday for tweeting racist things and she blames ambien.\n\nI struggle to be graceful towards others when they do something awful and say, \u201cI got too drunk\u201d and then precede to continue their typical drinking habits. I think people have decided that destructive behavior as it pertains to alcohol abuse is limited to things like driving drunk or having unprotected sex with strangers. But it also includes hurtful words and actions. \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to manage your drinking or stay sober, I would encourage you to self-examine. I beleive you need to take personal responsibility for your own behavior or you\u2019re not gonna make it. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you need to be self loathing and beat yourself up, but you need to honestly say \u201cI did x, y &amp; z and I\u2019m sorry and I\u2019m changing\u201d and that\u2019s it.

Some would say that\u2019s the only thing we can control (I tend to agree). Because you have to admit that YOU hurt someone you care about, jack daniels didn\u2019t do a damn thing.

I have so much energy its almost scary. I am hyperactive all the time, I talk and talk and talk, I walk very much! This is absolutely not a negative feeling I really enjoy it! I have been out twice now and the first time has been difficult, but the second time only the first hour or so. I have been drinking alcohol free beer to just have the natural feeling of being in a bar. Yesterday I have been drinking steadily like I would do when it was normal beer, but it was without alcohol :) and ffinally my friends dont try to talk me into drinking anymore. Something funny happened as well, my friend wanted to buy a round and came back with normal beer. I thought come on man! But then he told me I am sorry I tried to get you a non alcoholic beer but you drank their whole supply xD apparently they never really sell it.\nBut the soberness and not drinking has been in the back of my mind basically all week. The alcohol awareness has been there always. I notice now on day 7 I think less about alcohol. The cravings seem to come less and less and I realize more and more how mentally dependend I was on it and how much it took my life experiences away. That makes me also realize I am absolutely done with it. But I want to stay aware because before I know it sneaks in. It has been only a week and I know its a sneaky slippery slope that can sneak back into my mind at any point. Just one, you have it under control. It is very important for me to remember that I just don't, never have and never will.\n\nHave a nice sunday! "}

The truth is that as long as we continue to drink as alcoholics, we are slowly committing suicide. Fact. No if's, no buts, no maybe's. If we continue to drink to excess, it will kill us. By then, it wont matter that alcohol makes us act like dicks, or that it makes us late for work, or gets us chucked out the marital home \\- because we'll be dead. I don't want to die. I don't want my family to bury me because i drank myself to death. Life will always throw curve balls at us, but there is no problem on earth that a drink will solve. We can all do this. All we have to do is not pick up the first drink.

Sometimes they will drink something else instead of beer, but very rarely, sometimes it's more than 6 pack, also rarely. Used to be 12-pack 10 years ago, but decreased. Sometimes after consuming the beer this person doesn't even get drunk, sometimes gets really annoying and pissy and sometimes just succumbs to a deep drunken sleep... sometimes (extremely rarely) on the floor.

I apologize ahead of time if this seems like some text vomit here...\n\nSo, I\u2019m looking for some advice/input from all of you lovely people in regards to my situation.\n\nA little background here. I have been sober since 7/25/17 and have gotten sober through AA. Had a sponsor, followed directions as they were given, worked the 12 steps. After doing 90+ meetings in 90 days, I was going to 4-5 meetings a week.\n\nNow, life has picked up. I have a (non-alcoholic) partner, I graduate cosmetology school next month, I test for my cosmetology license and begin working full time in July... basically life is getting busy. I\u2019m finding that as I approach a year of sobriety, I have become much less dependent on AA. I KNOW that I simply cannot drink because I can not control my drinking, drinking does not make bad situations good, or good situations better, yada yada. I have no desire to drink or fix my problems with drinking. I also see a therapist weekly where I discuss my addiction recovery. \n\nMy question to you all... I feel like I can only extend myself in so many directions. My sponsor has told me that if I cannot attend at least 3-4 meetings every week, that she will not sponsor me. Would taking a step back from the program (NOT my sobriety, just the program of AA) be a huge misstep? Have you been successful staying sober without a structured program such as AA? I would really appreciate any feedback or suggestions from all of you lovely people. \n\nThanks in advance! "}

Yes, I call myself a boy, 'cause of the state I'm now I'm a little boy, suffering, begging for help and an end for the suffering. I'm a lawyer, graduated last year. So, I started drinking when I was 13 years, hidden of course, and it was fine until 15. When I smoked pot, got panic attack, developed panic disorder, dp/dr(derealization/depersonalization), anxiety stuff. I went sober then, and went to meds and benzos(&lt;---fuck benzos)\n\nI managed somehow to control my attacks without benzos, I *ONLY*(not meant to be used daily, but my doctor said it was not a problem) took them for sleep since 2011. Not anymore. GABA receptors were being attacked them. I started drinking again in 2013, when I got panic under control, just DR/DP left. And I fucking found that drinking relivied it. So I drank like 3-5 times a week, until I went 5-7 a week or the maximum I went, 18 days straight fucking binge drinking.\n\nNow, a former lawyer, no more university, I have no job, I'm housebound, I'm going to lose my driver license because I was caught driving under the influence of alcohol (not drunk, different things ok? Here in Brazil, low concentrations are influences only, like 2, 3 beers.) I'm also addicted to a benzodiazepine called Clonazepam.\n\nHere my \"sober\" story starts. I take this drug everyday. 0.5mg, when I do not drink. 1mg-3mg mg when I'm hangover (glutamate rebound and doc. said it was ok, they have no clue, it's not), but then I was 6 days today without drinking and FUCK. I couldn't stand. I'm not a weak \"boy\". I had tremors, shaking, DP/DR, anxiety, almost a full blown panic attack, I just didn't panic because I knew this was the alcohol withdrawal. I thought \"Victor, this is your 6th day without drinking in YEARS. It's a body reaction.\" And I drank 5 long neck beers today to ease me, and now I'm going to sleep with the aid of clonazpeam.I don't want to be ALCOHOL FREE forever, I know for a while I will be, But, I don't know how to do it. I have the willpower to not drink when I don't. I know I fucked up with binge drinking during 5 years. But I think I can't do it cold turkey, too much suffering, too much pain, too much HELL. Moderation is the key, I should listened that years ago... thx guys.\n\nI just need some non cold-turkey schedule for this.\n"}

It's a sports entertainment place that's only open a few days a week, so it's most people's second (fun) job.

Granted, a lot of posts to this sub do advertise luxurious non-alcoholic beverages, but I hate beer and wine so I tend to neck vodka, hence that market is not hugely relevant to me personally. \n\nThe question of why I don't stop is ludicrous. It seems almost as ludicrous as asking why one doesn't simply stop sleeping to get more things done.

This is a fairly new problem, I don\u2019t remember her drinking much when I was a kid. When they were older, she and my Dad started enjoying wine some more and until the last year or so she usually kept it to a glass a night. After finding the wine this time I just threw it out. I usually confront her about it but have given up on that because the conversation usually goes to four topics: \n1. She\u2019s not my problem to worry about. If it bothers me that much I can just move out (would love to if it wasn\u2019t for student loans) 2. It hasn\u2019t affected her work so clearly it\u2019s not a problem \n3. She\u2019ll be able to stop before it gets to be a problem \n4. The only reason she hides wine is because my dad and I give her grief when she drinks. \nThe last one is her favorite. Neither my father or I mind if she has a glass with dinner (I\u2019ll even have a glass of wine myself some nights). We also don\u2019t comment when she has a second glass. It\u2019s when she takes glass three after having two big glasses that sometimes we mention something. She\u2019s never been full on drunk but it\u2019s still concerning (probably because her tolerance is up). The part that gets me the most is a few months ago her brother had to seek help for his drinking. At that time she even admitted she wondered if there was a genetic predisposition. She still made no attempts to cut back! What do I do?Am I over reacting? Who do I talk to? She\u2019ll refuse to consider an AA meeting because she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t want to tell my father about this latest find because he has enough going on (new manangement at work and stuff going on with my grandmom). My mom just started seeing a therapist for her issues with depression but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s mentioned her drinking to them. I\u2019ve considered calling the previously mentioned Uncle but I don\u2019t know what he could do. This has truly driven me insane.

My daily mantra is \"no more poisen\".\n\nI am happy to rejoin this community again as an active alcholohic who is prepared to get sober. I am rejoining AA this week and plan to go to atleast 3 meetings a week.\n\nThanks for reading.\n "}

My longest stretch is 38 days. \n\nI wasn't an every day black out drunk but I did drink every day. I could drink without getting drunk. I could get drunk without \"incident\". But I would always wake up feeling ashamed...embarrassed, even if it wasn't warranted. Most of the time it was definitely warranted. \n\nI drove drunk. I said awful things to people I care about. I cheated. I put others and myself in danger. \n\nDrinking effected my work, my relationships and my health. \n\nI drank for the wrong reasons. Because I felt socially awkward, because I'd had \"a bad day\", because I was bored. \n\nI've been telling people that I've stopped drinking, most are supportive. Sometimes I feel like an imposter though, that I'm over exaggerating an inability to \"drink normally\", that not drinking doesn't need to be a priority because I don't really have a problem, some people agree with that.\n\nSo today I'm just gently reminding myself why stopping is important to me, and that  my drinking problem may not look the same as someone else's, but it's still a problem, just mine.\n\nI'm a much better person not drinking, and I'd like to keep being her. \n\nSo today, I will not drink with all of you :)"}

I find I only think about alcohol when a drink is basically placed in front of me or if I'm on SD, at AA, or reading a book about recovery, and thinking about drinking is stressful, I feel like I'm focusing on the past or parts of me that are weak instead of the future and parts of me that I'm working to grow strong. I was powerless to alcohol, and I feel like now I'm not, if I were, wouldn't I be drinking? I haven't had an urge to drink basically since about two weeks in. I have a lot of other self-work to be doing (managing depression &amp; anxiety) but even on my bad days, going to get a drink doesn't even seem to cross my mind. When I walk past the liquor store, am in a a bar with friends, etc it just feels like seeing an ex at a party and I'm like \"glad I'm done with her, jeez, what a monster she was\". I know there will likely be something anywhere between 1 and 3000 days from now where I suddenly want to drink again, and I want to prepare for it. Sobriety has been such a gift so far.\n\nI keep going to AA meetings because people speak so highly of them and because they conjure this fear in me and I figure that's good to conquer, I'm not particularly good at sharing my feelings. I don't really have any problem with the program, I just feel like I'm engaging with an older version of myself which kinda floods those feelings and memories back if that makes a sense. Like I'll be doing all this positive self-work and then on Wednesday when I go to the meeting, I feel like my old self. I like new, sober, positive me. My rational side says this desire to stop working AA is just the alcohol being insidious, but it feels much more like a calm decision instead of the erratic or frenzied ones alcohol usually pushes me to make.\n\nHave you had a similar experience? Did you end up not going to meetings or cutting some sobriety-related things out of your mental space so you could make room for your other priorities? How did that work?\n\nThanks for reading and responding, you all are the best &lt;3"}

It's got to stop. So Day 2.\n\nMy husband, he was the one with the drinking problem. Turned ugly mean after a few too many, and I stayed relatively sober to prevent anything bad from happening. Enabler, ahoy! Then one night things got REALLY bad, and the next day he quit drinking, just like that. It was pretty easy for him. He never needed to drink, just liked to, and decided ruining his life wasn't worth it. He's been sober 5 years.\n\nThe thing is, when he stopped drinking, I started drinking WAY more. I think not having to look after him anymore freed me to cut loose. I considered myself a \"good\" drunk. No big mood changes. Always responsible. And a lightweight - I throw up long before I ever get drunk enough to make a scene. \n\nFast forward to the present. I'm drunk every night on weekends. And a few weeknights. I'm sloppy, slurring, loud, and tripping. I rarely remember the end of any evening. Friends assure me I didn't do anything embarrassing, that I didn't even seem that drunk, but I wonder. I hate having to ask.\n\nI no longer just drink with friends. I reach for a drink when I'm stressed. At the end of a boozy night, I'm angry or weepy or incoherent with my husband.  I regularly depend on him to look after the kids on my party nights, to be the responsible one the way I had to be for him. To enable me, basically.\n\nMy kids notice. At a game, my 7-year-old asked me not to get a beer like I always did. AND I GOT ONE ANYWAY. I told her I'd just have one, and I did. But it stayed with me, the reality that I wasn't able to pass on a beer. That saying no wasn't an option.\n\nThis weekend I threw up after long day of drinking at two big parties. The kids heard me. They knew why I was sick. I'm not a \"dear god, think of the children!\" type but it's an ugly thing for kids to know about their mom. That she is out of control.\n\nSo Day 2. I'm confident I can last until the weekend. That's when shit will get real. All my social activities center on drinking. Beers at the game, wine on the neighbors' patio, drinks with dinner. I'm terrified. \n\nAll I can do is face one day at a time.\n\n\n"}

Since we quit drinking, my wife and I have always had a strict \"No alcohol in the house\" rule. We don't even keep cooking wine in the house...not because we would be tempted to drink it, but because having *any alcohol in the house* takes up space in our heads. Just having a bottle of cooking sherry would consume mental energy. Although we *know* we wouldn't actually drink cooking wine, the \"what if I took a swing\" thought would still pop into our heads. Making our home permanently alcohol-free gives a place to live in freedom and with clarity.    \nAnyway, as soon as they got into town, I laid down the law, plain and simple. I was open and honest with them about our policy. He and his wife (who isn't an alcoholic, but does drink) were very respectful and understanding. He definitely managed to get drunk when we went out for lunch and dinner, but it felt good to be up-front about how we felt.    \nI would highly recommend to anyone out there who is struggling in early sobriety to try to be as open as possible with your close friends (whether they are active alcoholics or not) about what you must do in order to maintain your sobriety. You'd be surprised how helpful this is to reinforce your support system. IWNDWYT."}

He's functioning but spent days drunk, urinated on the floor too many times to count, I found empty bottles hidden in the back of cabinets and stashed in the garage, he even started getting behind the wheel. Every week over and over we lived this pattern of behavior. I moved out for around 6 months or so after he drunkenly pulled out his gun one day. He swears he would never hurt me and only did it for attention and I believe him but that was a move too far. So we separated for a while and he swore he stopped and doesn't want to lose me. He had me convinced and we just moved back in together. Now he's sneaking drinking again. I have told him that I will support his sobriety and do whatever he needs of me to help and support him but if he continues to drink that I will have no choice but to leave him.

Started trying to change 3 years ago, and this group was probably the biggest help outside of friends and family. I started going to AA again, and while I've enjoyed some meetings and met some good people, last night I had an annoying encounter with an old fellow at the end of the meeting. I shared about my early sobriety, how I'm dealing with resentments, and my history with alcoholic family members and old crises. I recently found out my father has been 8 months sober (we haven't been close since I started trying to stop 3 years ago, but touched base when I called home for Mothers Day). That among a few other moments and realizations made Monday a successful Day 1. Anyhow, a fellow came up to me after the meeting and asked sharply \"What step are you on?\" I said \"well, 3, and I'm redoing my step 4 tomo...\" \"Do you have a sponsor?\" he interupted. \"Only a temporary one ri\" I said. \"YOU NEED A SPONSOR WHO'LL KICK YOU IN THE ASS SO YOU'LL STAY SOBER\". I was just shocked. Having alcoholics kick me in the butt growing up is a big reason why I developed a drinking problem. \n\nI got really angry, waved him off, and wanted to go straight to the liquor store, but I decided to keep it cool and came home first to relax and read some of the stuff in this group again.

They don't do anything to stop. \n\nThey drink every night. There's usually always a drink before dinner. Then a few after. Together, they go through like two bottles of wine a night. That's after their usually martini. Wine, prosecco, margaritas, rum and coke, gin and tonic, you name it, they probably drink it. \n\nWhenever my mom accomplishes something physical, like doing yard work, she drinks a few beers. Understandable, she worked all day. But she's not allowed to drink beer. Or much alcohol. Her doctor put her on a diet of no carbs and if she wanted to drink, she could only have ONE glass of red wine. \n\nShe goes through bottles of wine when she's by herself. I don't know how much my dad drinks because he's always away on business trips.  \n\nMy mom has also started to I guess drink and drive. On three occasions, while I was in the car, she's had a beer before or while driving. Today she did the same thing. \n\nI know she can't get drunk on one beer but I mean, she already has a DWI. Both of my parents do. I was in the backseat of the car when they were arrested. \n\nDuring party's, they drink a lot. Yesterday at a city celebration they each downed like nine bottles of beer. That's after my grandfather's 70th birthday party where, after my grandparents left, they preceded to get drunk and come home at 3 am. \n\nJust a few years ago, my mom, aunt and uncles were eating dinner in town. I was exhausted and ready to go home. No one wanted to leave so they told me to suck it up because they wanted to have a few drinks. So I suck it up. 1am rolls around and we're the only ones awake in town. My mom is smoking with these guys on the street and my aunt is fighting with my cousin. My drunk uncle took me and my cousin home. My mom walked in at like 3 am and she didn't know where my aunt was. She had to call her dad at 2am to come get her in the middle of the night. \n\nThis probably sounds small to you guys but this shit has fucked me up. I can't sleep at night because I'm always thinking of this. And I have to bottle it up because I can't talk to anyone near me about this. No one stands up to this behavior because my parents tell me to shut up about it and not tell anyone. My brother doesn't even seem to care any more- which I mean, he shouldn't cause all this shit happens when I'm around. I want to tell my extended family but I can't because all it will do is cause a huge fight and at the end of the day, I'll still go home with my parents and my mom will make my life hell because she's a narcissistic asshole. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore because I'm just sad now.

Im so happy for the changes I made and the results of the life choices I decided to stick with. I'm so happy to make the decision that alcohol is no longer a part of my everyday life, but today was a little reminder of what it felt like to be that person again. \n\nMy (real)name is unique and I've always appreciated that, but it also shares the same name as a brand of beer. \nI recently enrolled in school and started taking classes at my local community college. And having a unique name means correcting my professors on a regular basis. Today (well into the semester) my professor called me an incorrect name and for the umpteenth time I politely corrected her and she responded \"OH! Like the beer!\"  A few chuckles came from the class and I could only respond by saying \"yes, similar name to the beer\"\n\nIt really rubbed me the wrong way. Nobody in that class knows my story but it was so disheartening, because it was the first time since being sober that some One has said that. It almost felt like \"you are the beer\" or \"you and the beer are the same\"  I know this is not the case,ans I'm probably just a little sensitive but it really was an upsetting exchange that left me feeling like the alcoholic I used to be.  \n\nThis doesn't make me want to go out and drink, it makes me want to distance myself more from it, but I don't know how else I can do that. \n\nWhile Speaking on the subject of sobriety, I have left most of my interactions with (non sober) people feeling bad or crappy, or just reminded of the low life I used to live.

The addict part of me, the passionate, angry, self-destructive, crazy silly shit disturber is still there. And that was a relief honestly, because I didn't want to lose myself entirely in this transition. That energy is just channeled into healthier outlets, like painting and yoga and sex and dancing. \n\nI remember saying at one of my first AA meetings that I wasn't sure I could continue staying sober because alcohol hadn't ruined my life (aka I hadn't hit rock bottom), so it felt like I was giving up so much for so little in return. A man replied that the thing about sobriety is that it just keeps getting better, and there's no way to describe what it can give you, you just have to experience it. At the time I thought that was a load of shit but as it turns out he was right. Everything in my life seems to have gotten better even though the only thing that changed was my decision to stay sober. \n\nEvery day I feel more and more free.

I would say the main reason I relapsed was that I did not work the sobriety and I convinced myself I could be \u201cnormal\u201d.  My disease Convinced me the reason I could not control the drinking when I was younger  was that I was immature and irresponsible. 2 years ago  I controlled it ok at first and mostly stuck with beer however when I was not with a friend or my wife I gave myself the green light to get obliterated. I would fake not being hungover around my teenage kids and wife and lie about where i was and how much I had to drink. I eventually became severely depressed because I hated who I was which was a lying, self\\-absorbed, self pitying, guilt ridden, often sick , irresponsible phony. I have now stopped for 12 days and believe in the bottom of my heart that if i don't stay sober I will lose it all and die at a relatively young age as a disgrace to my children. I am in a much better place and even at times jubilant. Unfortunately I also have episodes of depression still where I feel guilty and fearful of the future not drinking. I also still romanticize drinking because it has been a big part of my social life for 35 years. I get angry other can enjoy it and i cannot. It is also everywhere in our lives\\-tv, music, all media, FB, Instagram etc. I am hoping that as the days go by I stop thinking about it as much and just can enjoy living."}

It is obvious things have changed profoundly - most of the time I can now go to my supermarket and going into the wine section doesn't occur to me at all. Sometimes I don't even notice it didn't occur to me! \n\nMy Saturday nights, now I have re-instated a pre-drinking daze habit of not going online at all on a Saturday, I look forward to reading a book and enjoying the relaxed, but clear-headed treat of quiet time in my rocking chair reading until I can't stay awake any longer. The idea of drinking seems utterly unattractive.\n\nWhen I walk past some of my formerly favourite wine shops in nearby cities I don't want to go in. Sometimes I even forget to think about the fact they are there.\n\nMy weight is going down, my brain has finally returned, and I seem to be experiencing a bit of a quantum leap in my professional life and in how I feel about my own worth in my field.\n\nAt the same time, sobriety is like my dog. He's a stubborn, badly-trained pound rescue Staffy. Love him a lot but he's not an *easy* dog. Neither is my sobriety habit. I still get the yearning sometimes for a bottle of wine - he still doesn't know he shouldn't leap up at me and try and knock me down. I have to keep teaching him \"down\" and \"no\" the same way I have to keep teaching my lizard brain \"no\" and \"fuck off\".\n\nJust having the dog around is not enough. They need feeding, and watering, and attention and toys and a cosy place to sleep and mental stimulation. So does my sobriety, it needs all those exact same things for it to survive and thrive.\n\nIf I ignore my dog, he might just decide to jump the fence and run away. He might take to biting visitors. He might destroy the yard and our back verandah couch. A bit like what would happen if I ignore my sobriety and have \"just one drink\". Bye bye peaceful life. \n\nMy dog is not real good at coming when he's called yet, and we certainly wouldn't trust him walked off leash - he might eat a terrier, knock over an elderly person or just take off into the sunset. Same with my sobriety. Just sitting down and calling it and expecting it to come to me has never worked. I have to actually work at the relationship. And letting it off the leash would be a sure way to see Lizard Brain seize the day. While I can trust that would not result in my eating someone's pet, other things I care about would almost certainly be damaged in some way.\n\nThe cool thing about my dog, despite being badly trained and somewhat eccentric and lacking any sense of respecting personal space is he really does hold me in high regard. You'd think I just made the sun come up he's that pleased when I appear. It is so true what they say about dogs, they love unconditionally.\n\nSobriety gives me a lot of the same good feels. even when I feel utterly crap about everything else I'm doing, knowing I am sober is  this waggy-tailed thing that radiates good vibes towards me. It's the one thing that so long as I stick to it, I know I can get right. There's not many things in this life like that, where there is no chance of stuffing it up so long as I show up, day after day, not having that first drink.\n\nJust like there's no chance of dog deciding I'm not his human anymore, so long as I show up, and treat him right.\n\nI suspect that as I keep going with sobriety I may even discover that I am capable of just the same kind of unconditional appreciation of life as my dog. He might be a lacklustre student, but he's one helluva teacher :)\n"}

You turn into an emotional mess and don't make the best decisions.\n\n--\n\nAfter about 6 months of sobriety I started getting really lonely, craving a connection with someone so I joined Tinder, OKCupid and tried a couple others dating apps. At first I was terrified at disclosing my sobriety to others let alone dating sober. After a few awkward dates I quickly learned it wasn't a big deal in fact I was connecting better with people because of it.\n\nFast forward to today, I somehow ended up dating a heavy drinker who is emotionally unavailable. I don't know how I ended up here, I ignored all the signs because I'm a sucker for a pretty face that's into me. I cross-addicted - I didn't drink a drop of alcohol but I became love drunk in the arms of someone else. And when I realized I was being used, it hurt. It really really hurts. Only now have I realized that I'm not ready for this and I have a lot to work on before I feel healthy enough to date again. I'm so lonely and hurt but I'm still sober at least.

A year or so ago my wife was crying in bed saying she married a drunk after she got home around 7ish and I was drunk juggling knives and cooking a five course meal making a mess out of the kitchen she had just cleaned.  After that night I quit drinking for 23 days until we were having sushi and I kept saying how I wanted a beer but thought I could moderate, even though secretly I knew it would lead back to me sneaking shots when the wife went to the bathroom or hiding beer cans before she got home and brushing my teeth.  I could feel my liver the next day hurting from the amount I was drinking consistently.  My grandfather on my mother's side was a drinker, same with my dad though in much more moderation around the kids, we never saw him drunk though, my brother and his wife had been clean for 5 years or so now.

{"author": "OtherwiseClassic", "creation_date": "2018-05-19 04:13:43", "selftext": "Hi everyone, this is my first post to the group, and also first post on reddit. So I've known for over a decade that I should quit drinking, but pretty much did nothing about it. In the past year or two I've had moments where I could envision a future alcohol-free life, but continued to drink excessively. Two days ago, on Friday morning, I woke up hungover, embarrassed about things I'd done and said (again) and late for work. I made the impromptu decision to call in sick, make it a four day weekend, and embrace sobriety now, rather than continue assuming I would do it \"someday\".\n\nSo I'm trying to ride out the cravings and start building a support network. This is day two without alcohol, cigarettes, or cannabis. Since they're so interrelated I'm trying to do them all at the same time. I feel uncomfortable. My stomach is a mess. My head is foggy. My muscles are sore. I'm having nic fits. But I've also spent these two days resting, trying to be kind to myself, joining online communities, researching in-person meetings in my area, reading books on sobriety, watching youtube videos on sobriety, and downloading sober apps to my phone.\n\nNine months from now I will reach a milestone birthday. If I start focusing on sobriety now, I can potentially enter that new decade of life in a totally new head space. I believe I can do this because I've dealt with hard times, sickness, grief and loss in the past. Despite my current physical discomfort, I'm feeling hopeful. But I also learned about the \"pink cloud\" phase for the first time today and it made me start to feel self-conscious and cautious about my optimism.\n\nI have tried and failed to permanently quit cigarettes before, but not recently. I have never tried to permanently quit alcohol. I have made it through several dry Januaries in the past (during which I gave up alcohol, tobacco, sugar and coffee all at once), but not recently. The longest period in my adult life I can remember not drinking is six weeks, but the last time I achieved that was maybe eight years ago?\n\nHowever, for the past year or two, in addition to a nagging feeling that I would be sober some day, I have also been writing periodic journal entries to my sober self while drunk. They're kind of like dispatches to myself--messages with creative ideas, insights, recollections. But also, conversely, they're about the way drinking makes me feel mentally anguished and trapped. It's my drunk self telling my sober self to pay attention to what I've been suppressing with alcohol. On Friday morning, after calling in sick to work, I found one of those journal entries sitting open on my computer, but had forgotten that I had written it just a few days before.\n\nThere is a part of me that is very curious about sobriety and how it can expand my life. I want more time, more money, more energy to pursue my goals and interests. I don't want my days to be dominated by cravings or compulsions. I want to reserve my time for real friends, instead of spending it on bar friends. Although I am proud of the good things I have achieved in life, I also know that I have not lived up to my full potential. My life feels too small right now, and sobriety is my best chance of expanding it.\n\nI know that I need to find a community of like minded people. As far as in-person groups go, I'm hesitant to go to AA for several reasons, although I think I will go ahead and try a women-only or LGBT meeting at some point. I am also considering Smart Recovery and buddhist-oriented recovery groups.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, thank you for reading this. I'm interested in your thoughts, experiences and stories. Does any of this resonate with you? What have you done, read, seen or tried that has been helpful?\n\nCurrently reading: This Naked Mind by Annie Grace"}

Othertimes I drink extremely fast and cannot have an empty glass in front of me.\nI'm sorry if my post is unclear and lacks a point, I guess I'm hoping someone can relate to my situation or experience and offer advice or assurance.\nIm fairly sick from 2 bottles of red wine last night. This is my first time reaching out about drinking. I know I can stop drinking tomorrow for a few days then I'll feel great at the weekend, like a few beers would make things more enjoyable, then the cycle will start again.\n\nThat's a very long post, if anyone can advise on even a single point I'd appreciate it "}

This is a fairly new problem, I don\u2019t remember her drinking much when I was a kid. When they were older, she and my Dad started enjoying  wine some more and until the last year or so she usually kept it to a glass a night. After finding the wine this time I just threw it out. I usually confront her about it but have given up on that because the conversation usually goes to four topics:\n1. She\u2019s not my problem to worry about. If it bothers me that much I can just move out (would love to if it wasn\u2019t for student loans)\n2. It hasn\u2019t affected her work so clearly it\u2019s not a problem \n3. She\u2019ll be able to stop before it gets to be a problem \n4. The only reason she hides wine is because my dad and I give her grief when she drinks.\nThe last one is her favorite. Neither my father or I mind if she has a glass with dinner (I\u2019ll even have a glass of wine myself some nights). We also don\u2019t comment when she has a second glass. It\u2019s when she takes glass three after having two big glasses that sometimes we mention something. She\u2019s never been full on drunk but it\u2019s still concerning (probably because her tolerance is up). The part that gets me the most is a few months ago her brother had to seek help for his drinking. At that time she even admitted she wondered if there was a genetic predisposition. She still made no attempts to cut back! What do I do?Am I over reacting? Who do I talk to? She\u2019ll refuse to consider an AA meeting because she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t want to tell my father about this latest find because he has enough going on (new manangement at work and stuff going on with my grandmom). My mom just started seeing a therapist but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s mentioned her drinking to them. I\u2019ve considered calling the previously mentioned Uncle but I don\u2019t know what he could do. This has truly driven me insane. I\u2019m anxious all the time about her hiding wine and checking her hiding spots has become a part of my daily routine (that\u2019s how I found this wine). I hate feeling the need to check the wine totals every night but I really can\u2019t trust how much my mom is drinking anymore. Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated."}

Do I drink because I like alcohol and choose to drink it, or am I addicted and justifying what I do?\n\nI've always liked strong liquor, and never understood why some people think neat liquor is too strong to drink. When it comes to alcoholic beverages, I've always preferred drinks that are over 50% in alcohol content. For me it's always been about the taste and the warm glowing sensation it causes.\n\nI used to drink 2 glasses on the majority of days, at night before going to bed. And I don't mean just gulping down 2 glasses, but sitting back with a book or something on tv, sipping from my glass at the end of a busy day. Never more than 2 glasses.\n\nI've always been careful not to get drunk, simply because I hate being drunk. Sure, it's happened a couple of times in my adult years, such as on newyears eve. Even then, I was legally drunk but still able to talk, walk, and know what I am doing.\n\nSince I've always been aware that logically, there has to be a line where a controlled habit becomes an addiction, and because of that I regularly decided in a pseudo random manner to not drink until the end of whatever month it happened to be, which meant I would not drink anything for a period that could be between 1 to 4 weeks. This was just to prove to myself that I was not having a problem.\n\nIn my inexperienced opinion, maintaining control is what makes the difference. I'm curious to know if that matches what people here think.\n\nBtw, I've quit alcohol altogether for about a month now. Not because I don't like it anymore, but because I have a medical issue for which I need to lose weight, and alcohol is one of the things I scrapped from my day, together with sugary snacks and other junk.\n\nI didn't think quitting would have any effect at all because it was not difficult, but one surprising thing I noticed is that now I dream more often, more clearly. And it takes me less time to go from grumpy to awake."}

It struck a cord with me because the main character and I share the same name and the same feeling of loss. The one thing that he had that I didn't was a sense of hope.

However, I think that part of my mental illness is to shift the focus to weight loss \\(not that I really need to lose any more\\), not alcohol, and that allows my alcohol soaked brain to rationalize that only 1 or 2 boxes, if I skip dinner, won\u2019t really make me fat, so..... yeah, you get it.\n\nI\u2019m basically 100&amp;#37; A\\-OK all day with the exception of the late afternoon/ early night window, where my brain attacks me with every single reason why I should have some wine 'just tonight\u2019. For me, if I can push through the window of 5\\-7 pm, the rest of the night is easier settled into my routine in my night clothes. Then it\u2019s MUCH less likely that I will make a wine run. Sometimes, depending on what\u2019s up, that window does expand to about 3:30 to maybe 8. So a max of 4.5 hours, but usually just 2 \\- and it\u2019s that stretch of time, in spite of feeling calm and confident all the rest of the day, that really do me in.\n\nIn addition to the health reasons for quitting, I have been emotionally absent from my husband and children for years, and honestly, we\u2019re seeing the effects at this point. I have become almost reclusive, not wanting to go anywhere or do anything other than come home, sit in my corner, drink and watch something or read \\(if I\u2019m not too blurry\\). This is really a big thing for me. It was a breakthrough in March, when I invited my husband to accompany me on a business trip. For 2 of the 3 nights, I had minimal, pretty much normal consumption of a couple of glasses, but blew it on the middle night, sucking down a whole, super expensive bottle of wine in the stall of the lobby ladies room. So stupid, and missed a great dinner. Roller coaster \\- up and down and up and down.\n\nTrying to make it stick this time, it\u2019s May 4, and I haven\u2019t had a drink all month \\(all 3 nights!\\). I\u2019ve joined this Reddit group \\(my first\\), gotten the Nomo app on my phone, and I read the Flipboard alcoholism articles every day. I also write in my diary, still titled, \u2018Dry January\u2019. ha. It really, really helps me get through the bewitching hours, if I have done this \u2018work\u2019. When I don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m much more likely to rationalize and blow it.\n\nI am glad I joined this group, because you all sound so lovely, non judgmental, and supportive in your comments to folks who struggle on this front."}

I used to cross stitch but gave it up because I would rather hold a wine glass than thread and needle. \n\nThis has to stop, and tonight will be Day 1 of not drinking anymore.

I tried that before and all the feeling of obligation drove me back to the bottle. I needed help in the first place, not anybody else.\n\nI've been trying my best to be good to people since. I often succeed. But if I feel like the old habit is trying to kick in, then everything is permitted. If I need privacy or attention, I take it - I had to learn how, but it can be done. I'm no good to anyone smashed from liquor.\n\n2 - It's about people.\nCommunities, support groups, therapists, friends. Sometimes even family is nice. My tries to tackle my drinking on my own were helpful in one way - showing me how they just don't work. Cause that is what defines the problem for me. You can't stop it yourself.\n\nThe best memory I have from the rehab is when around day 70 out of 90, a bunch of people basicaly told me that they thought I was a proper cunt during my first month but now they are really glad that they met me. That's because I learnt to shut up sometimes and rather listen. To say what I mean even if it is not pleasant in a way that is not hurtful. The feedback showed me myself in another light, or in the light of others. A mirror wouldn't work that way.\n\n3 - There is a reason.\nYou can put IMHO before these paragraphs, because it is something I deeply believe to be true - you don't have to of course..\n\nThere is a reason for drinking. There was a reason for every drink I ever had and there have been many reasons to my addiction.\n\nSobriety is useless for me unless I can challenge those reasons. Abstinence is a tool, not a goal. It keeps my mind and body ready, functional. It helps me deal with the REAL problems. Addiction is just a symptom.\n\nI drank cause others did it. Why did I want to be like others? Whx didn't I stop when others did (way before I lost control completely)?\n\nI drank cause it was easier to flirt with girls. Why couldn't I do it sober? What is my relationship with women? Is there something I fear?\n\nI drank cause it was fun. What about the fun of other hobbies? I used to play guitar for hours every day, why did I stop?\n\nAnd so on, and so on... Not always, but more often than not, there is a reason. And there is a choice what to do about it.\n\n\nThank you for reading, stay strong for each other, I will not drink with you today.\n\nTL;DR: I dont blame you, I thought it would be shorter."}

Am I lying to myself thinking that this isn't a big deal?\n\nEdit: The worst part is, right before I went to bed I looked in my bathroom mirror and, for the first time since  I stopped drinking I really looked at myself, and I almost didn't recognize myself.  I have had a puffy face for years and tonight I actually looked totally different.  No puffiness, no redness.  I looked pretty great.  I can't stress how much of a change it was.  And it made me sad that I made a mistake by drinking.  It made me realize I need to keep up being sober because I am actually seeing results.  Maybe cutting ~1500 cal. out of my day will make me lose some weight as well."}

Just a few mimosas with the family, and it was lovely.  Didnt think much about alcohol or drink beyond that.  \n\nUntil last Friday, when I drove to Tucson, AZ.  Tucson is this shitty little town where I went to college.  It's where my alcoholism developed, where I dropped out of school, but I have tons of friends there.  My hair stylist also lives there, so I drive to Tucson to see him and get my hair dyed.  Im weird, and getting my hair dyed red is part of my identity.  Lately my scalp has been a little damaged from allergies and itching, which makes the dying process unbearable, so I normally have a painkiller or a few drinks before he starts.  Only thing is, this time, I didn't stop.  Over the course of a good 4 days, I drank 2 bottles of wine, and 3 bottles of hard liquor.  \nI made a lot of really bad sexual decisions, as well, so now I'm very scared for my health.  And there isnt a lot I can do about it except abstain from sex and wait 3 months to get tested.   \n\nHere's to starting over.  I love that I was able to drink with family without any negative consequences.  But it's fair to say that at this point, it's just too great a risk for me to think I can entertain that sort of control.  I'll probably be really annoying and posting a lot until the 3 months is up, so sorry in advance.  "}

The obsession to drink \u2013 to get alcohol, hide alcohol, drink alcohol, hide my drinking, and lie about everything under the sun \u2013 consumed me and left me a shell of a person. I have friends, hobbies, interests these days. Life is more predictable, with its less-calm moments mostly driven by my need to inject a bit of adrenalin into my life and not because I\u2019m locked on a psych unit or passed out on the front lawn.\n\n \n\nLife isn\u2019t perfected by any means, of course. I still struggle with depression and anxiety. I relapsed pretty heavily into anorexia and bulimia after I became sober and I am still wrestling with the perception of being a fat person trapped in an underweight woman\u2019s body. And of course life has its natural ups and downs which I am immensely more able to cope with now that I don\u2019t drink.\n\n \n\nThings definitely get better. They don\u2019t seem like they will, especially in the beginning. But they do. My drinking-self could not imagine going without alcohol for more than a day or two; I thought I needed it to function, to handle my emotions and deal with the boring-mundane-ness of my life.

In the past, I would spend all of January sober to reset my system and then resume my regular drinking schedule of 5-15 beers a night with a day or two sober each week, and the occasional blackout. \n\nProblem is that last year I spent 3 weeks sober and I wanted to fucking die. It progressively got worse every day until I finally broke. In the past it was only bad for a week. I've been spending the last year trying to cut back to something more manageable, but decided to skip the sober January this year. I feel like I've been doing well, keeping to 5-10 beers most nights and never blacking out. The problem is that the more I get my drinking under control, the worse my anxiety gets. I don't blackout and I rarely get hungover anymore, but I have panic attacks about every other month and overwhelming anxiety once or twice a week. My anxiety is worst, not the days I'm sober, but the days right after.\n\nLast week I got fairly drunk every day, like only 10 beers, but not eating a lot of food. I'd pass out early and feel fine the next day. Then I accidentally sobered up the past few days because I had an international flight path lasting about 48 hours and I decided not to bring any shooters with me. Then when I arrived I just passed out from lack of sleep. At about 60 hours of being mostly sober (a couple of tiny cups of wine on the plane) I all of a sudden got hit with shakes and a wave of anxiety bordering on paranoia. I bought a six pack and tried to even things out, but it was too late. I was able to sleep maybe 3 hours last night, but my head is pounding, my whole body hurts, and I can't escape from this intense worry and self loathing. I fucking hate myself right now and feel like a worthless piece of shit. I called off work (I never call off work), and have been lying in bed feeling like crying all day and dry heaving occasionally.\n\nSo here's my question, has kindling fucked me at the nice young age of 32 or is it that I'm just an anxiety ridden wreck?\n\nI've never had a seizure or anything like that. On top of that, my family has a history of serious mental illness, and even though I drank a few beers last night, I still want to die today. So I'm leaning towards major anxiety coupled with minor alcohol dependency, but maybe it's the other way around. Maybe I'm just in denial because I can't ever see myself quitting drinking.\n\nIt's 4pm now (in China). I haven't eaten in 24 hours, but I'm cracking open a beer. I wish I had some benzos instead, but I don't know where to get any. I just want it to fucking stop."}

I usually drink on fri or saturday, and the times I don't drink on the weekend I end up drinking during the middle of the week.\n\nI grew up with people who drink so much, all the time pretty much, some every day, some every weekend. It seems to be a part of my culture. \n\nI don't usually have any horrible experiences when I drink to scare me off from drinking, yeah, when I was a teenager I got into some fights and that kind of stuff, dropped my phone on the ground and breaking the screen has probably been the worst of it. \n\nThe reason I want to slow down or stop (I honestly don't know if that is possible since I get so much enjoyment from drinking) is because it seems like a waste of money and I want to learn to have fun without drinking.\n\nI stopped drinking hard liquor a long time ago, that was a bit of an issue for me. Now I generally drink beers I feel are somewhat healthy, ones that are organic or brewed in Germany. Many times I have bough 8 beers, planned on only drinking 4 but then end up drinking 6,7 or maybe 8. I pretty much have a difficult time stopping if I am in the comfort of my own home, I feel like I am chasing the feeling of bliss that I get from drinking beer and listening to music. Once I have had a few I generally don't give a fuck about my plan to only have a couple, I'm having too much fun and it seems worth it at the time. I feel like I have so many drinking triggers, sunny day, walk in the forest, meeting up with friends, the weekend, stressful day, awesome day, hanging out at the park. Every single thing I do seems to be about 4 or 5 times as much fun when I am having a drink. The hangover the next day is not really bad compared to the amount of fun I have. I don't know if it's because I'm just different but I get very happy, strong feeling of bliss, general contentment and also, I seem to be able to get into some sort of head-space where I can analyze and think about things thoroughly and honestly feel way more creative and better at seeing my life problems from a wider perspective. Is this normal? I do smoke weed so maybe the combination has this effect. I don't get drowsy or angry or anything, although I have can feel a bit more emotional. \n\nThe last time I drank was on Sunday, It really feels like it's been a week already, I had a bit of a rough day, the sun is shining and I want to have fun but I have a meeting tomorrow morning so I am not going to drink tonight although I have a very strong craving.\n   \nI remember the first time I tried drinking was when my Dad asked me to make him a vodka and orange juice, I was really young maybe 8, that's when I got my first taste and my curiosity was piqued. When I was about 13-14 I first started craving alcohol. I grew up in a very aggressive atmosphere with lots of yelling and fighting and have dealt with anxiety and depression, alcohol has unfortunately been the cure. I have stopped drinking in the past thinking that my anxiety would go away but it doesn't.\n\nHow long does it take for cravings to stop? Why does my anxiety seem to get really bad after not drinking for one week?"}

My uncle fucked up his life because of the alcohol, and maybe my grandmother, mother and other uncle are alcoholic.

Right now I am 24.\n\nI've always been afraid of alcohol, of drunk people and of getting drunk. There are countless reasons for this. But I've always known that I COULD be an alcoholic because of my genes.\n\nI've become quite fond of beer and like pretty much any alcohol, except vodka. However, I only drink in very controlled environments: alone, with my mother, or with my boyfriend.\nIn the last five years or so, I've built up my tolerance to the point where I can happily drink 6 common beers, 6 shots of brandy, 2 glasses of wine, and still be fine. (I weigh about 49 kilograms, or 108 pounds and I am a female) Beers are like water for me now, but I avoid drinking with coworkers or strangers in general because I'm afraid they'll judge the amount. \nI like beer (and the other alcohols) because of the taste. I am quite selective and try to become an expert in beer. I do not drink for the sake of the effects of alcohol, which I do not experience and do not wish to. At most, I'll feel dizzy and I'll stop. But that doesn't really happen anymore. Also, I drink a lot of water while I'm consuming alcohol.\n\nIn a week, I drink two to four days. Usually it's anything between a normal beer to six beers per day. So there are weeks when I consume 2, and weeks when I drink about 24 beers. Normally it's about 6 beers per week. \n\nI do not feel anxious if I cannot drink, and I have a lot of chronic health issues going on, but my first question is to the doctors is: \"Can I still drink while I'm on this medicine?\" Beer is the only thing I actually WISH to ingest; for some reason I've lost interest in food. I eat, but I'd rather drink. I can afford my consumption. I have always been a responsible student and employee.

I made a post recently enough about considering whether or not to drink at my upcoming secondary school graduation, and the occasion passed just last night - and sober too! It wasn't easy, I won't lie. After the ceremony we were told to get dressed in the school classrooms, and the drinking began then. Everyone whipped out bottles of vodka and cheap bottles of wine and began to neck them together. It was a bit uncomfortable and isolating at that point, being awkwardly ready to leave but everyone still pre-drinking and dancing around made me feel like I stood out a lot, but I know nobody paid any heed realistically. Usually I would be the \"life of the party\" in those moments amongst my old friends outside of school, and when I don't have many friends in my school, I wanted desperately to join in and almost prove myself to them that I was fun and bubbly too, yada, yada.\nThe night itself was enlightening in so many ways. Before leaving the school, we were invited to chat with teachers and get some food, take some photos, and all that. I finally introduced my favourite teacher to my wonderful boyfriend, and I was so, so proud to tell her we wouldn't be drinking. It was refreshing, and motivating, and made it really felt worth it. \nWhen we reached the pub I spoke a while to my French teacher. Usually I would be very shy around her, and I know that if I was drinking around her I would definitely be thinking to myself \"god she probably just thinks I am really drunk and acting stupid\". I hate that feeling when I'm drunk talking to somebody sober, or less drunk than me - thinking that they are cringing at me and judging me. It's always especially worse when paired with the \"I know I am drunk but I mean this\" ramble.\nThe amount of money that we saved too was so exciting! Pubs are still expensive but we spend like 7 euro between us over the course of like 3 hours - which would usually easily be ten fold if we were having alcohol. \nAt the moment we have about 3 bottles of cider and a bottle of wine in the fridge, so we have been looking forward to getting those out of the way. I thought I would be excited to come home, crack open a cider and watch some Bobs Burgers, but when we got home I wasn\u2019t mad for it really! We went through two cans of Outcider together but I had under half of one can in total I\u2019d say in total. I haven\u2019t ever been big into the taste of alcohol, so that\u2019s been helpful. It\u2019s actually been really exciting to be reluctant to drink the wine, considering I don\u2019t really like the taste, I only ever liked the effect.\nI\u2019m looking forward to having it all out of the house so that I can add my flair at last! It\u2019s been scary to think about it being a permanent, strict thing for me. I have thought about keeping it to \u201cno drinking if there is a risk of getting drunk/tipsy\u201d but I fear that that is a very fine line for me. We will see. For now however, I am definitely delighted about this achievement!"}

I am extremely committed to following through with sobriety this time as i've went through the whole binge drinking cycle one too many times to continue drinking! I want my life back. I am generally a very happy person but this withdrawal is really taking a toll on me .I've just joined this community on reddit and it already has been incredibly helpful.  Any support , motivation , or advice would mean more to me then i can explain.  Love and Peace!"}

So I guess most of my friends would count as above average in consumption. \n\n3 years ago I lost my GF and my consumption has been very high since. And I have been concerned about my own alcohol use. The past years I guess I am up to 30 units a week on average. Which is not good. I also drink alone sometimes, just because I dont have anything else to do and it feels good.\n\nI have had several alcohol free months because I am a little concerned that I am becoming addicted, the last one in January. The first week is always a little hard but then it is okay, no withdrawal symptoms. But then I always go back to drinking because my life is just so boring otherwise. I think that is actually my main problem. I dont have that passion, and I am bored of being a student. I drink to kill time. And because I love to get drunk of course. \nMy grades are okay ish. Could've been a lot better but after 5 years of reading Im kind of fed up. \n\n30 units a week is too much, I know that, but I feel I can control it pretty well. \nI guess my problem is my reason for drinking. I drink to get drunk. To get away. To kill time. It is kind of born out of dissatisfaction. \n\nShould I simply reduce my consumption to below 21 units per week? Or am I delusional about my own abuse and in need to stop now and forever?"}

It's 91 days now and... wow. \n\nI don't think I've been this happy in a long time. I've grown socially, emotionally and mentally. I lost (and this is a real number) 18 pounds from just cutting out the alcohol alone. I've impressed tremendously at work- so much that my salary was raised to a number that makes me extremely comfortable. \n\nLike I said, I don't consider myself an alcoholic. When I decided to quit, it was a simple and easy choice. I never felt any physical temptation to go back to alcohol and I find myself pretty lucky for that. \n\nBut I think that this would be valuable for those like me. Those who lurked around here for months but never actually stepped to the challenge. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter if you're an alcoholic or not.

Try it out. 90 days of sobriety can reveal some surprising things about yourself. \n\nLastly, I do want to thank this community for being what it is.

I have had a lot of trouble coping with my mental illnesses, which I feel, plays a role in all this.\n\nBasically I've finally made a commitment to my therapist to stay sober from alcohol until tomorrow (my next appointment), and then go from there.

This is the first time I've even remotely stayed with it. \n\nTo put it bluntly, I feel as if my world is crumbling around me, I don't know who I am outside of substances anymore. The sheer blinding anxiety from all of this is vomit inducing, I lay wrapped in a ball multiple times of the day crying and hyperventilating, just wanting to drink so so badly.\n\n My husband pointed out about a year ago, as soon as I get a panic attack (which is multiple times a day since 10 yes old) , I lunge for the bottle so I can dull the sensation. And now, as you can imagine, I don't have that, so my panic attacks are coming more swiftly, more often, more intense, and I don't have the alcohol to run to. I know my brain needs to find another outlet and I need to use better coping skills. I've been giving myself credit at the end of each day saying, \"I made it.\"That's all I feel like I'm doing is making it, floating through each day just trying to make it through, and I look forward to sleeping, I wish I could sleep all day, but I can't.\n\nMy husband has been my life these past few years, especially now. But I know, without a doubt, if he didn't stop me, if he weren't around I would definitely be drinking , and I hate that.

I have a beautiful family with 2 healthy kids and a loving, supportive husband who words hard. I have a 3 story house and a new car and I don't have to work. I have an adorable solid black German Shepherd puppy. I have everything and yet I have nothing without my sobriety. \n\nI was so fucking sick the last 2 weeks from the drinking. A week ago I went to bed at 5pm on a Friday and didn't emerge until Monday morning, leaving the house only twice under lies to get more alcohol. I just laid there and drank and watched the neighbors outside living their lives. I drank more and I puked. I drank more and my kids came and asked why I was sick. I took probably 10 benadryl with the alcohol just to go back to sleep. \n\nThen early last week I drank a 5th by lunch time and told everyone I was driving out into traffic and had to go to the psych ward by ambulance. My legs were hairy, I had so much body odor, I hadn't brushed my teeth, my face was puffy and covered in acne. It was truly a disgusting sight. I got there at noon with a BAC of .3 and was already in withdrawal by 5. \n\nI went to the doctor the next morning to try to get some help but they wanted me to go inpatient. That's just not a choice whatsoever. My husband is in a very prestigious school and cannot even miss one day and if I were to be gone we could lose everything. \n\nI knew it  was up to me. This was the end of the fucking road. I was going to have to taper. I had been waking up at 1-2am every single morning in withdrawal. Sweating, shaking, hallucinating, heart rate in the 160s.

My entire life has become one big revolving door of waking up to drink myself back to sleep while everything around me goes to shambles. \n\n\nSo, I did my taper which ended at 5pm yesterday. Normally I'd be up right now watching the clock like a hawk and counting the 19min til it opens. I'd be the first one in there buying 2 24oz Icehouse which is embarrassing in and of itself but it's the closest store and the best thing they had that wasn't $10 (so my husband wouldn't ask what I spent $10 on) and they would make me feel better until the real store opened at 8.\n\nThis morning I feel a sense of calm. I slept 7 hours last night for the first time in 2 months. No pounding heart. No sweating. No compulsive thoughts. I'm ready to face this day head on. \n\nI'm ready to live. Here's to day 1, take 30.

So I didn't and went to bed and slept great.\n\nThis morning I woke up with gratitude and clarity: it's just my addiction that wants me to drink and not get better. \n\nWith this newly found insight I will gladly make the decision that just for today, I will not drink alcohol.\n\nThank you for every single post made on SD. It reminds me that we together have a single goal and that is to stop the BULLSHIT and truly live life. I read about 10 posts daily now and it's clearly a big factor in my sobriety. It keeps me on the right track.\n\nIWNDWYT!"}

I had to fly 2x a month to school (several states away) for my program... the rest was online. I was terrified of flying, so I started getting drunk on the planes. Like, really drunk. It eventually turned into me getting drunk before doing homework, me getting drunk after class, and then me getting drunk all of the time- funny how that happens, eh?\nAt the last semester (last August) I decided to begin my sobriety journey. I opened up to some close class mates about needing support. One of them replied, \"I don't understand why they say that relapse is a part of recovery... doesn't that encourage relapse?\". I thought about this for a while. I eventually replied with something along the lines of that fact that I believe that so long as we learn from our mistakes and reflect on our relapses, it makes us stronger and more in communication with our sober self. I tried explaining the disease, the change in dopamine, the neuropathways, etc... and she replied, \"OH! It's kind of like my food addiction!\". She actually started reading This Naked Mind with me, and worked on her food addiction. She then understood the \"relapse\" and how it can be a tool in recovery, as long as she was learning from it.\n\nI've read This Naked Mind twice. I check in here 4-5x/week. I've been to a few AA meetings. I've opened up to my family. And I still relapse. I used to become extremely discouraged about my relapses. But, it has taught me to learn more. Study more. Reflect more. Teach others about this nasty, shitty disease to reduce the stigma. Just like school- if I had a bad grade on a paper, I needed to study more. Focus more. Take it more seriously. Just like sobriety. \n\nAnd just like I don't expect to become the perfect professional once I graduate (in JULY!!), I don't expect to be perfect about my drinking. I need to be agile, learn from my mistakes, be open to further tools and education, and set the bar high for myself. Life-long learning has become my goal, and I hope someday I can pay it forward and teach all that I have gained from my degree in sobriety. \n\nIWNDWYT!"}

Maybe I'm wrong for reasons I didn't  foresee or maybe AA already has tried is/is doing this already.  Sometimes I wonder if the reason why Alcoholics Anonymous is anonymous is because of \"prejudice\" against sober people. I've noticed a lot of girls unmatched me on Tinder after I told them I didn't want to get drinks at the bar. It's not that I don't have self control, its not that I have a problem with others drinking, it's just that I dont like entitled people that think I owe them a fucking drink, and I don't wanna hang around a bunch of drunk people at a bar, getting nasty looks for not having a drink. Yes, I've been to the bar in my 11 months of sobriety, but I swear I didn't have a drink, only food. I know that's the oldest excuse in the book, but seriously it's the honest truth. \n\nIn many ways, this has made me demoralized, and felt alienated from American society, which has caused an unhealthy resentment I don't know how to resolve. Especially in college, drinking booze is a norm, if you don't drink, something must be wrong with you, and you must be avoided like the plague. \n\nIn my 11 months of being sober, not a single person has asked me if I wanted to get a drink with them. Maybe, I just want a friend that can accept me for deciding to stay sober and realizes that because I'm sober doesn't mean I have a problem with them having a few drinks. Idk. Maybe I just have a problem with booze culture in the US. Maybe I'm sick of seeing ads against my will that promote booze as this thing that will get you women on my loneliest days :,(\nYou always see a hot girl with a beer, or a guy surrounded by women, while holding a beer, perpetuating this notion that if you want to get sexy women, you have to drink to attract women.\n\nWith all these sexual harassment scandals in the news, I don't see why booze needs to be poured on top of it! Granted, sobriety doesn't necessarily make people morale, but alcohol makes people horny, and not so long term thinkers, put the two together and you have a recipe for disaster, like sexual harassment/assault. \n\nMaybe what these colleges need are more sober men and women. Not by force, of corse but by choice and positive encouragement. You need to make sacrifices to be successful, that mentally has kept my sobriety going these almost 11 months. Sometimes sober people need some positive encouragement that they are doing good, cause everyone I know, drinks, and almost most of them talk shit about my sobriety and how stupid they think I am for not drinking, or don't care at all that I feel alienated by society for being sober. \n\nI think it's natural this day in age to feel like you don't fit in for being sober especially at my young age of 21. In my honest opinion, Alcohol is more important to most people than Christianity. Maybe I shouldn't generalize like that, but hell, it's my honest feelings. \n\nLemme know your thoughts. If you think I'm dumb, or crazy, let me know. I have thick skin, I can handle it. If I can handle 11 months of sobriety at the ripe age of 21, I can handle some trolls. "}

I\u2019ve been a lurker of this sub for a while now and finally mustered up the courage to post about this issue I\u2019m having. I\u2019m 27 years old, and been drinking for about 10 years. Earlier this year I told myself that I was done with the horrors of hangovers and stupid crap I\u2019ve done while intoxicated and decided to go sober. I lasted about 2months without a single drop. I finally caved when I attended a family vacation at big bear and proceeded to get obliterated, which in all honestly was a stupid decision on my part. Well since then I\u2019ve been drinking 3 times a week again.. sort of going back to my regular schedule. One night, about 3 weeks ago, I hit the pub with a couple of my buddies and proceeded to drink the night away as we usually do. I filled up on the greasiest food I could find that night and stuffed my face. Typical Thursday night for us. That night I woke up at about 3am with my heart beating out of my chest. This had never happened to me before in my drinking history. I knew something was wrong and called 9-1-1 immediately thinking I was having a heart attack or something. Long story short, I ended up at the ER with the doctor telling me that I had suffered a panic attack. He mentioned if I drank alcohol or did drugs. I told him that I\u2019ve over indulged in a fair share of alcohol throughout the years. He then mentioned if I had stopped abruptly at any point recently. I was kind of shocked at that question because just earlier this year I had stopped for 2 months. I mentioned to him about my sober kick earlier in the year, and he proceeded to tell me about how that may be the issue. How if I\u2019ve been doing something for years I have to ween myself out of it. Since then I\u2019ve been having these night time panic attacks and anxiety throughout the day. Today marks my 2 weeks of being sober again, and plan to go through with it this time. I\u2019ve realized how unproductive alcohol has made me and how much it has deteriorated my body. I no longer crave it and have picked up on some hobbies to keep my mind of of it. My question is, have any of you experienced high levels of anxiety or panic attacks since stopping? Is this normal? How do you cope? Sorry for the long rant. I just needed to vent and hopefully get some answers that make me feel like I\u2019m not alone. Thank you for reading."}

Following a 20-minute meditation, one person after another talked about how wonderful sobriety is and how helpful meditation was in their program. Finally, a 40-ish man raised his hand.\n\n\"I have a serious meditation practice,\" he began. \"I have crystals and shit. But sometimes I really just want to fucking kill people. It's not always full of peace and joy.\"\n\nPeople laughed nervously. When the meeting was over, I went over to him and thanked him for his share. I needed to hear it.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love hearing from people who are thriving in recovery. I love pointing my browser to SD and reading posts from those of you who are enjoying the gift of not drinking, whether you have five days or five years. It's truly inspiring.\n\nBut I also think it's necessary sometimes to hear from people who aren't doing as well. I've found sobriety to be an enormously positive development in my life. But since stopping drinking, I've dealt with depression, loneliness, listlessness, confusion, and rage. Didn't I also have these problems when I drank? Definitely! But just because I stopped doesn't mean they all went away. \n\nOne reason the pink cloud effect can be so dangerous is that it tricks people in early sobriety into believing that their lives will be on an upward trajectory from that point forward. So when you do experience setbacks \u2014 maybe you don't make it to the gym for a week, or binge eat, or feel like you hate life and don't want to leave the house \u2014 you may feel like you're doing sobriety wrong and wonder whether it's worth it at all.\n\nYou don't have to lose weight when you're sober. You don't have to find a relationship or strengthen an existing one. You don't have to get better at your job or like it more. You don't have to have better relationships with your friends and family members. \n\nYou don't have to do anything at all except not drink. Manage that, and you're \"doing\" sobriety correctly.\n\nAnd if you feel like shit, don't hesitate to say so here. That's what we're here for. Meetings, too, are a safe space to be candid and honest.

{"author": "hinuk", "creation_date": "2018-05-23 03:50:29", "selftext": "I'm here at 200 days.  Listen, life is hella better without alcohol in it.  I didn't drink super \"often\".  But that was mainly due to the fact that I was still doing mental gymnastics to hide it from everyone around me.  I spent a lot of time angry about the fact that I wasn't able to drink as often or even as freely as I wanted to.\nI \"cherished\" times where I could be alone to drink.  When my still-boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) was out of town, work trips, trips to visit my family when my fianc\u00e9 could not make it.  Those were the times I would try to drink the most.\nThere were also nights where I became emboldened to wait until my fianc\u00e9 fell asleep, and under the guise of \"being on the phone with my mom\", or \"doing work in our basement\", or whatever excuse--I would get wasted in our basement, alone.  Listening to music, cruising the internet.  Texting friends, calling people I typically didn't have the energy to talk to.  I felt like I could be \"happy\" and \"normal\", and do the things I knew I needed to do (e.g. call someone I had been meaning to reach out to), but when sober, didn't always want to do.  \n\nAnd I drank to get fucked up.  I wasn't under some disillusionment that I was going to drink to have two glasses of chilled white wine and call it a day.  No, the planning involved in this wouldn't have been worth it for only two glasses of wine.  These events had a minimum of a box of white wine (preferably Black Box pinot grigio), and then at least another bottle or two of brut champagne.  Dry white wines.  At the end, that's the only thing that could sit ~ok~ with me.  Other things weren't \"working\".  And I liked the type of drunk I could get with wine. \nI also coupled my drink with Blu menthol e-cigs (which on their own, sober, make me feel like absolute shit).  By the way, I wasn't a smoker, a former smoker, or someone trying to quit (When I drank, I often let people assume and take pity for me, for the fact that I must have been a \"former smoker\" as I clutched my ecigs).  Somewhere after I graduated law school, a law school cohort a year ahead of me, who had become a practicing attorney, and himself, a problem drinker--said that smoking ecigs helped him in his office during the day.  And it was much more acceptable and easier to hide than an actual cig or chewing tobacco--which was what he preferred.  This guy had been a childhood friend of mine.  I know that within the last year or so he has had one bout of pancreatitis which lead him into hospital care.  I'm not sure where he is with those things now.  I don't speak with him much and consider him an acquaintance.  I do wish him well though.\nAnyway.  What I learned was, since my body had been previously burnt out from stimulants and caffeine, nicotine could cut my alcohol intake.  A little.  Probably minutely.  But, I bought into it.  And soon enough, I paired my drinks with ecigs.  \n\nLast spring (2017), I had a bit of sobriety on my own.  Less than two full months.  It was a serene time.  I remember feeling awful when I knew I was going to break my sobriety.  I hadn't reached out to anyone or told anyone about going sober, so turns out, it was pretty fucking easy to break my sobriety.  After that relapse, the summer was kind of . . . blurry.  I had a busy summer with work.  Where I excelled.  My drinking did not get in the way there.  I mean, I think. I'm sure it leaked in, if I'm being honest (which I am).\n\nI remember feeling disappointed that I had broke my sobriety before I got my new puppy.  My fianc\u00e9 gave me a puppy for my birthday.  I felt great guilt every time I drank after we got her.  I thought it could be a new leaf for me to turn over.  Get sober for the dog. \n\nNot how it works, guys.  I mean.  It can.  I've heard of many a dog as a Higher Power before (in fact, my dog isn't just \"the dog\", but the love of my life, and quite frankly, part of my Higher Power).  But, I didn't have those tools yet.\n\nAnyway.  The culmination of my drinking spiked at the end of summer/early fall of last year.  I found myself doing things that became more concerning.  Nothing that got me into grave trouble or danger.  But.  Concerning.\n\nI can't remember the circumstances, but I had one afternoon off.  Knew I had an extra bottle of champagne around.  Drank it.  Realized my tolerance was more fucked than usual.  Was drunker than I had \"planned to be\" or that I could hide.  And had to think of what to do before my fianc\u00e9 came home from work that afternoon.  I was supposed to be traveling that week for work.  But only a couple of nights, and not that far away from where we lived.  So, naturally, I called him to tell him that I was unexpectedly needing to leave for one of these trips out of town, and that I was sorry I wasn't going to get to say bye to him.  He bought it.  I threw together a bag of clothes, got a bunch of fast food, and got a box of wine.  Drove my ass to a hotel right in the town we live in.  Not even a necessarily nice one.  Kind of a sad one.  Not very well lit.  \nIt did have a refrigerator, though.  And that kept my wine chilled.  So, for the night, I was safe to drink my boxed wine in a plastic hotel cup, watered down by hotel ice machine ice cubes.\nWhat I forgot to pack was, unfortunately, my anxiety medication.  Which I did not take when I was drinking--because you know, death.\n\nOh--I should mention.  I have had serious anxiety issues my whole life.  Didn't realize it, until it manifested itself into full blown panic attacks at age 21.   But, like many of you here, and us in the world of alkies, yeah.  I had debilitating anxiety.\n\nSo, after passing out from a pretty lackluster night drinking watered down wine in a shitty hotel.  I woke up at 5:30am with screeching anxiety.  And for the first time in a long time, an upset stomach.\nI panicked when I couldn't find my anxiety meds and realized I would have to wait at least 2 hours until I could drive my sorry ass home to get them.  I had a very hard time driving when I was in the middle of a panic attack and was worried the anxiety would be too strong before I could make it home.   Again, I had to wait until my fianc\u00e9 was out of the house.  Because, otherwise, what were the lies all for?\n(Did I say earlier I hadn't put myself in danger when drinking--because that was a load of fucking bullshit if I ever heard one).\nAnyway.  On top of anxiety.  I needed to puke.  Something I never had to do after drinking.  I prided myself on it, in fact.\nBut here I was.  In the shower, trying to warm up to take the chills away (from the anxiety--and withdrawal), and oh, oops, I'm puking in the shower.  And oh. Look at that.  The drain in this shower isn't working.  I'm actually showering in my own puke.  Cool.\nI proceeded to get out of the shower.  Kind of cleaned out the puke but not really.  (When in college, I briefly did housekeeping, so my apologies to the housekeeping staff that morning--truly).\nAnd then I had to wait.  Wait until my fianc\u00e9 got out of that damn house.\nIn the meantime, I puked a few more times.  Once in the sink as I brushed my teeth.  Maybe twice more in the toilet.  Can't really remember all the details.\n\nWe had gotten cameras for inside our house, and had outside security cameras.  The inside ones to watch our new puppy while we were at work.  I decided I would use those to help me gage when my fianc\u00e9 finally left the house.\nI decided I needed to get on the road before my anxiety fully kicked in, and felt it would be best to hide on the street on the other side of our house as I waited for my fianc\u00e9 to leave, so I could get those god damn fucking anxiety meds.\n\nI waited at least 30 minutes on that side street.  Waiting and watching on our inside camera.  Watching my fianc\u00e9 have a peaceful morning.  Shuffle around carefully and happily (he isn't a drinker and went full teetotaler quite some time ago).  He got to have a nice long goodbye with our pup before he went off to work.  It all looked so, happy.  Nice.  Normal.  Peaceful.\nI cried as I sat on the other street watching this as I was shaking like a leaf from my anxiety and withdrawal.\nI wanted what he had.  Peace and serenity.  Not this fucking chaos.  \nTo be there in the mornings and enjoy it with them.\nHe finally left.  And even left early.  So as to get to work early.  Unlike me, chronically running a little late, but telling myself my long hours and huge workload, gave me that excuse.\nHe left.  I ran into the house.  Cried upon seeing my dog who was confused when I picked her up and kissed her and hugged her.  Took my meds.  Called my office to say I was running a little late, for god knows what reason.\nAnd knew I was fucked.\n\nThat wasn't the end of my drinking.  But it certainly was a marker for me of what I considered a bottom.  \nI continued to drink more often, two times a week, instead of two times a month after that incident, which really then lasted, about a month and a half longer (the drinking).\nI closed out my drinking with two more experiences--one, a work trip, wherein I drank so much I missed a ton of awesome opportunities for courses I could have sat in on.  Hid out in my hotel room, when I could have explored.\nAnd then had my final drunk, in my old drinking spot.  My basement.  Hanging out with idiots on YouNow.  People I didn't even know.  But felt comfortable enough to talk with while I was drinking.  \nThat last drunk, I knew.  It was different.  I had gone to the liquor store hating myself a little more than I ever had.  Hating the people in there more than ever.  Even as I poured the drink, my anxiety roared.  \nIt was no longer fun.\n\nI texted a friend I knew who had been in recovery and involved in AA for a long time.  She asked if I wanted to come to a meeting.  I went to one.  Barely 24 hours sober.  At that meeting, a colleague of mine (who I did not know was sober), was receiving her 18 year sobriety chip.  She was surprised to see me.  I was surprised to see her.  I sent a congrats email to her the next Monday at work.  \nWe have since built an extremely nice friendship, and I adore her.  \n\nShe got to watch me receive my 6 month chip this last weekend.  And was very proud for me.  My whole group was.  \n\nA couple of women I've gotten to know in recovery have recently relapsed.  Some have tried to come back.  It seems harder.  Guilty-er.  Less fun and light.  I know they can get it back, but I can see their disappointment.  Others have fallen off.  One in a psych ward.  Another, kicked out of her kids' home.  \n\nOver the course of my last 6.5 months of sobriety, I've had lots of ups and downs.  My anxiety has gotten better.  Much better.  I'm better overall, at handling things.  \n\nI feel that, karma/the universe seems to agree with me better as I lead this life of sobriety.  I don't know if it's true.  But.  It seems to.  \n\nI don't live 100% honestly.  I have still told lies that I have not worked through in my 5th and 11th steps.  \n\nI've worked through my steps fully and often feel guilty that I'm not doing enough or that my sponsor, who is sweet and wonderful, thinks I could be doing more, not just for myself, but for others like me.  And I know she is right.\n\nBut.  I'm doing what I can, on most days.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9, as the title denotes, happened to propose to me.  Unrelated to the sobriety.  But, honestly, maybe not.  I asked him the other day as I was struggling to tell him I was planning a relapse, how my sobriety has affected him.  He told me his own life has gotten better because of it.  He doesn't have to feel as worried and anxious for me.  He cares a lot about me.  It would break his heart if I went back to hurting myself.\n\nInitially, I didn't lose weight.  In fact, I was getting thicker it seemed.  But then, after his proposal (and also, feeling more comfortable after the first couple months of sobriety), found it pretty damn easy to knock off 19 pounds (I now sit about 15 pounds down--but it can fluctuate).  \n\nI look hella good, y'all.  I gotta say.  I look pretty good.\n\nSo why on earth, in the last week or so, have I been suddenly feeling almost \"unable\" to think forward the thoughts of relapsing?\n\nWell, I have two travel plans in the next month.  This coming weekend, back home, to a lake, which I have done now, at least a few times sober.  But one, requiring flight, in a few weeks.  This type of travel and business travel, I have not done yet, sober.  I'm future tripping.\n\nAnd maybe other things, too.  Getting caught up.  I'm just.  I'm caught up.  Instead of letting myself live.  I'm ready to self-sabotage.  The \"ism\" in my mind has lead me to believe something I spent 6 months knowing was untrue--that the few hours of \"relief\" I artificially get from a poison doesn't outweigh the after affects. \n\nAnd I needed to share this all with you.  Whoever is so brave and kind enough to read this to the end.\n\nI am struggling the worst I have in sobriety.  And I really want to believe, I will make it through the other side.  I will make it to my wedding this summer, continuing on this little train of sobriety.  One 24 hours at a time.  \n\nI guess that's the kicker.  I just have today.  I certainly can allow myself to think about my wedding, how disappointing it would be to fuck up before such an important event in my life.  One I will share with the man who is so proud of me for who I am, and the sober life I now proudly lead.\n\nAnd the work I do.  For a very long time, I felt terribly guilty for the work I do professionally, and the fact that I couldn't honestly look people in the eye and talk about behavioral health and addiction, knowing I myself was struggling.\n\nIt just, it all doesn't compute.\n\nIt seems pretty worth it to stick the course.  Even though, I promise you guys, it is so fucking hard right now.  And as my fianc\u00e9 leaves tomorrow night and I am alone, without he or my puppy until Monday.  Jesus.  This is going to be potentially hella fucking hard.  But I have you guys.  I have my sponsor.  I have folks to reach out to.  I have books I need to re-read for my own benefit.  Allen Carr, This Naked Mind, memoirs, non-AA and AA related reading material to carry me through this weekend.  A weekend that's supposed to be sunny.  Where I have the luxury of sitting on a brand new pontoon, on my favorite body of water.  And read.  Enjoy life.  Breathe.\n\nHow the fuck would I not choose sobriety?  At least for the sake of that god damn fucking 3 hour drive I have to make to and from where I'm going, that would be a bitch of a sad drive home if I drink this weekend.  \n\nCan I end on that?  That visual image is enough to keep me sober.  Fuck's sake.  \n\nAnd you guys, too, on a sentimental note.  You guys keep me going.  We can make our lives how we want it, and I see a lot of people here doing that. \n\nI feel a duty here, to be one less person who has to say, \"hey guys, sorry, relapsed.  It sucked.  Badge reset\".  And discourage you on your journeys.\n\nAnd that may be a little too egotistical for those versed in AA, but I do feel a duty.  This is a responsibility, sobriety.  For myself.  For my alcoholic mother, to see me sober.  To break the cycle that has been before me for generations.  \n\nBut mostly, for myself.  Because before my dad died when I was 16, before I had my first drunk after that, also aged 16--I enjoyed a life of sobriety.  That child-like happiness.  \n\nI haven't found it again yet.  But I'm one step closer by being sober.  \n\nI will not drink with you all today.  And I plan to check in every day, here, to continue not to drink with you.  Each 24 hours we have at a time.\n\nThanks for reading, and I love you. \n\nEdited to say: I didn't proofread until now, and I apologize.  Probably will leave it just about as is for now. \n\nEdited: proofread and fixed some spelling errors/clarity.  not great, but hopefully better. "}

{"author": "VendorTrashCash", "creation_date": "2018-05-24 08:56:41", "selftext": "Let me put some things in perspective. I have exactly 1 friend who's a girl, and the only reason we started talking was because I messaged her blackout drunk my first night drinking grain alcohol. What happened with her is an entire story for another post, but suffice to say alcohol was my crutch.\n\nBut then again it wasn't. I remember one night in my sophomore college dorm, I desperately was trying to work up the courage to talk to this different girl. I was already about 6 shots in, and I don't know about you but that would be enough for most normal people.\n\nBut it wasn't enough for me, so I drank some more. Still wasn't enough, still too scared. So then I drank some more. I think I finished the night on somewhere around 11 to 13 drinks, and it still wasn't enough. I learned that night that apparently being a coward is so ingrained in my personality that no amount of liquor would fix it.\n\nBut I still tried. Fast forward a year, and by that point I had, on separate occasions, stolen all of my one roommates beer one night, tried unsuccessfully to water down my other roommate's liquor so I could steal it, thrown up in the bathroom and had to replace everything in it, and endangered myself countless times. I tried to quit during my junior year, but a couple months later I found out that one of my roommates was having sex with that first girl I mentioned not 20 feet from my room. I started drinking again.\n\nGood news is I've been alcohol-free for over a year now, and I don't doubt for a second that it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nBad news is that I think alcohol has been a major factor in why I've been FA for the entirety of college. While everyone else was having fun and connecting with each other freshman year, I was too scared to do anything. While everyone else was having fun and connecting with each other sophomore year, I was drinking myself half to death while still being too scared to do anything. While everyone else was having fun and connecting with each other my last two years, I was instead focusing on alcohol recovery, all the while still too scared (and now too depressed!) to do anything.\n\nNow that college is over, I feel like I drank away all of my opportunities to become a normal person, and now I'm developmentally stunted with relationships and sex. I can't express interest in women sober, and because I was one step away from being an addict I never learned how. Now I'm behind and I hate it.\n\nOn a more superficial level, it now means that bars or any alcoholic occasion is right out as a way for me to meet people. The only thing worse than trying to socialize with a million drunk people is being the only sober person in the building while trying to socialize with a million drunk people.\n\nAs always, thanks for sticking with me if you read the whole thing. I really needed to get this stuff off my chest. &lt;3\n\n**TL;DR** I drank away my college years in an unsuccessful attempt to get more courage. I had to quit and now I feel like I am without my only social crutch."}

I just want to get my story off my chest and let go so I can move forward. I want to forgive myself and I'm feeling so much shame and embarrassment right now.  \n  \nI have been drinking all of my adult life. I started at around 15 with my boyfriend who could get alcohol from his older friends. We drank on and off socially and on weekends together. I eventually graduated and moved to college, rooming in the dorm with my best friend. I chose what college I went to based on the fact that the boyfriend (a year older than me) had gone there. Best friend and I had a difficult time making friends and therefore stayed in our room and drank constantly. Thus began my foray into serious alcoholism. I missed a number of classes and was getting even more depressed than I had been. I had a number of issues, including some sexual abuse from a boyfriend at 14. I had turned all my hate inward and was self harming pretty frequently.  \n  \nSix months into college I overdosed on Tylenol and went to bed. The next morning I was vomiting what felt like pure acid. I called my parents who asked my roommate to take me to the hospital. I was in the ED and the nurse who took care of me was condescending and even after giving me the antidote nonchalantly said \"Well, you could still die from this.\" I was hospitalized overnight and my parents came and took me the 2 hours back home. I withdrew from school. I never was hospitalized inpatient for my suicide attempt.  \n  \nWhen I got back home I spent the next few years doing just over minimum wage jobs and feeling sorry for myself. Depression was at a critical level and I contemplated suicide a lot. I gained a ridiculous amount of weight and ended up over 300 pounds. At 5'5 I felt like an elephant. I hid my alcoholism from everyone. Drank in my room alone.  \n  \nDuring this time I met some people on Craiglist, met a number of guys online. I was manipulative and a terrible person for a while. I broke a number of hearts and had my heart broken a number of times. All of it boiled down to my self hatred. I took it out on everyone else, especially when I was drunk.  \n  \nEventually, I realized I had to do something about my weight. I had not been able to be compliant with a diet and my parents were supportive so I got a weight loss surgery. As I started to lose weight, I gained confidence. But what I didn't realize is that because of the smaller stomach, alcohol now hit me faster and harder. I spent a decent time sober, met a guy who was great, and lost a bunch of weight. Until I decided I was ok to drink again.  \n  \nThe next few years were marred with alcoholism. The guy stayed with me and supported me through it all. All the nights that I drank so much that I puked and then drank more. When I quit my job in a hangover panic. When I came home from work sobbing every day because of depression and anxiety and then turned to the booze again. I became a verbally abuse drunk. I have always been empathetic, which was great when sober because I could really help people, but terrible while drunk because I could really dig hard at people. I have always known what buttons to push and for some reason I am very articulate when drunk. I also blacked out constantly. I'd have no memory of how bad I treated people.  \n  \nI ended up getting sober for a year. I was sick and tired of it all. I thought I was at rock bottom. He and I moved away from my hometown, I got a new job I enjoyed and things were great. But we were not great. In this time we had grown apart, or I had grown apart. We became more like roommates than lovers. Best friends but not in love. At least, I wasn't in love. I started drinking again.  \n  \nI met another man, who I had known for a long time. I regret this to this day, but we had an affair. I never told my guy, but I left him because I didn't think it was right and I felt such tremendous guilt. He was such a good man and I was so wrong. I started drinking very heavily again after leaving due to the guilt and shame.  \n  \nI have hit rock bottom now. I am still with the man I had an affair with and he is a wonderful guy too. Supports me through everything. Lets me live with him. Forgives me for black out making drunk decisions that are awful. I spiraled to the point where I drove drunk, something I promised myself I'd never do. I bought little wine bottles and would drink them when I got 5 minutes from the house so that I could hide my drinking. He knew me enough to realize.  \n  \nOver the weekend I embarrassed myself in front of his family and his sister's family. I then proceeded to get mad at myself, sit in the bedroom and punch my legs. I woke up hungover, painful and depressed. I have little money due to compulsively shopping while drunk. Am in a stupid amount of debt at the moment. But I started sober yesterday.  \n  \nThis got way too long, but the point of it is, I am not that person anymore. I am my sober self. I have done it before and I can do it again. I have been hiding in my room due to shame (We live with his family atm because I need to pay off debt and save money). He spent all day yesterday with me making sure I was ok. He watched over me while I slept last night because I was having bad dreams. I told him to tell his family about my alcoholism and to apologize for me. He did and said they seem ok with it. They are not very formal and conservative as my family.  \n  \nI'm still ashamed. Not sure if I'm leaving the bedroom today. But I am sober. I have a job where I can eventually pay off my debt. I have a guy that I adore and that loves me enough to help me get through this. I will not ruin it this time. I will not hurt anyone else. I will not hurt myself. I will get through this journey to self love and forever sobriety. I am myself today.  \n  \nIWNDWYT  \n  \nIf you made it through my story, thank you. I appreciate the listening ear and shoulder to lean on.  "}

I probably will have another drink at some point in time. But that time is not today. And it wasn't yesterday, or the day before, or the day before. \n\nA week ago, I would've thought this was impossible. Every day I looked forward to that warm fuzzy feeling in the evening, but every couple days a niggling inside voice reminded me I wasn't looking forward to it. I was actually dreading the shackles of habit, familiar burn of vodka, but it was a burn I knew. It was a weird thrill to sneak drinks and act sober around my partner and see how drunk I could get without him noticing. But I was missing the best moments with him. Drifting off dizzyingly drunk every night meant I forgot our pillow talk. Us having sex. Our intimate moments of cuddling before sleeping. And I hated myself for that. That's not who I am, or even was a year ago. \n\nEvery time I drank, I wanted more. People noticed this. Wine-tasting, beer-tasting, etc was a significant part of my relationships. It was how I relaxed, bonded, and grew with people. Unfortunately, the anxiety and apologies that accompany the morning after over-sharing or acting out dampen the soul, gradually yet insistently. Not to mention the health problems.\n\nOn Monday this week, I decided enough was enough. I decided that just for 24 hours, no alcohol. When out to dinner with my partner, he mentioned drinks after, and I said \"not today, ... maybe not for a week. I feel like it's becoming a habit and I don't want that to be the case. I'm having trouble stopping at just one beer or one glass of wine, so I'm going to take a break\". He accepted that without hesitation, and asked if I was okay. I said I was. \n\nI wasn't. But I will be. \n\nTwo days later, with 2 runs, 2 trips to the gym, and no drinking, he said he was proud of me. I hugged him tighter than ever. I think on some level, he knew alcohol was an issue. But I'm glad he let me discover that on my own time and is supportive as I figure myself out. It's only been 4 days, but I love waking up without a hangover. I love that my bloated body is returning to its normal state. I love that I can have another chance. I'm finally not ashamed and hiding all the time (physically and mentally), and it's such a freeing feeling. \n\nThank you to this community for being there. For showing me change is possible and sharing your stories. This is more of a self-reflective post than anything, but if anyone reads this, I will not drink with you today. "}

I'm actively trying to leave that part of me behind because the drink is slowly killing me and my already sensitive self-image. \n\nBut he was right, it would be a shame to skip another summer laying in bed with the lights off, barely being able to move because I drank half my bodyweight in malt liquor again.

It would be a shame to not be able to fit into the clothes that I like, or burn a hole in my wallet ordering-in because I'm too drunk to cook. Will I miss out on the old summer BBQ piss-up? Maybe.

I simply don't drink alcohol, but heeeyyyy, I do still party (and remember the night before and don't feel like a jackass in the morning, checking my phone to see who I texted, and am able to go running or to crossfit early, and wake up without a hangover....and my skin is clear, my mind is clear, I've lost 35 lbs...the list goes ON and ON!!)\n\n\n\n\nI had a really long day at work and even though I worked my ass off, I feel like I got absolutely nothing done. I'm tired, and sad....and feeling left out. \n\nWhen I left my last account today, the GM said we will celebrate our soon to be completed goal with shots...I just smiled and said \"oh yes\" and he laughed, and I laughed and then I walked to my car and felt this.....sense of jealousy. This sense of why the fuck can't I have some drinks? \n\nI went to the gym, came home and have been picking fights with my husband all night. Looking enviously at his glass of wine, and eyeying the vodka in the freezer. I can't talk to him about it, I tried to tell him I had a bad day and he just thinks I'm being a bitch. If I tell him I want to drink, he'll look at me sympathetically and say he should not drink in front of me....oh yes, that's better, go hide and drink. Not.\n\nThe issue out of all of this is.....how I reacted to The comment the gm made about shots. I wish I would have said that I don'tt drink alcohol, but I agreed at a future date to have a drink. Now it will just be awkward....dude doesn't care that I don't drink I'm sure. It is weird in the industry I'm in not to drink, it would have been strange for me to tell him I don't drink....like, there were so many people around and I'm sure he didnt want my life story. \n\nSorry I rambled. Just feeling a little sorry for myself. "}

I was drinking up until right before I went to bed, which I realized isn't healthy for sleep. So, I am now on day 4 of no beer, but I don't feel much clearer, or different.  I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms.  I do still crave beer starting around 3pm when I would normally have a 1st beer, but that is habitual I think.

Chained to it. It was the central focus of my life. Everything else blurred out of focus. My relationships and professional life suffered, as well as my sense of purpose and meaning. Now these amazing things have snapped back to focus. I can truly enjoy life and live up to it's expectations for me, instead of constantly being disappointed by my own expectations for life.\n\nIt sounds crazy but in my drinking days I was in a constant state of boredom or obliteration. I was rarely satisfied with living and the things in my life, let alone happy joyous and free. What used to take a pint of vodka, some beers, and some other party substances to feel okay, is now my baseline most days. And when I'm not feeling good it's either because I've been slacking on my daily actions for maintaining my emotional sobriety, or something deserving (like the loss of anloved one) is at the root of it. In other words, it because I'm not supposed to feel good in that situation.\n\nSD has been an important part to my continued growth, but getting involved in the steps and AA was also a central component of my transformation. \n\nCongrats to all who have ndvs this week and the realization that you can not only be okay in any and all situations, but you can really savor and enjoy your relationships and new experiences now.

'things' have to click for people before hard self work can be done. and thats clearly harder for those on the margins/ in poverty/ who are poc/ indigenous/ queer/ etc. i am often motivated by my own belief system, for a while i believed abstinence wasnt a practical outlook for me. my daily life and interactions have so much to do with holding space for other peoples trauma. having grown up with abusive/ drug addict parents/ have 3 alcoholic - drug addict sisters/ and a myriad of friends who have died from heroin/ suicide/ i found myself very terrified of feeling impervious. which is something i think about a lot. my mom told me that when she quit doing heroin/ a lot of her old friends confronted her with hostility/ shaming her for her hard self work. which makes sense when you feel left behind and like healing is a weapon used against you. its sad how complex addiction really is. i believed that my relationship with alcohol needed to be met with truly understanding why i was so untrustable while drinking? what my motivations and intentions really are? and if it was possible to enter a world of moderation/ or ritual based drinking. for example/ harvesting berries/ making wine and drinking it like once or twice a year. something like that. what i have realized is that sobriety is excruciating/ its so much about embracing the mundane. staying present/ doing self work/ being accountable for the way i treat my body. the few times i have stepped into my idea of moderation/ i have been left with the same self hate and emptiness/ even if i didnt behave badly or obscene. i currently am practicing total abstinence from alcohol, bc i feel its the only way to overcome the spiritual disease that comes with alcohol addiction. since it really clicked for me that moderation wasnt an option/ i can now go to social events and interact with people. dance/ and feel reassured knowing i will not be problematic. having special NA beverages helps but i dont want to rely on that. i honestly dont know anyone who is tackling d.i.y alcohol sobriety without things like kratom, weed, or la croix. i really believe plants can help with addiction and that is why some of them are here. however, im afraid of trading one for the other. though, thats how it works sometimes. i do not think healing/ or sobriety is linear. some days, i feel totally back at square one. alcohol has been part of our lives throughout history in deep ways. strange ways. harmful ways. when life gets unbearable it makes itself very available. quitting alcohol hasnt validated me as a person in this world and in some ways people i have really topsy turvy relationships with in the past/ still come for me whenever the f they want. sometimes its warranted and sometimes it feels malicious. what i have learned is that all of our behaviour is visible/ and until you really commit to self work and start doing it/ you remain suspicious to others who are willing to hold you accountable (it works both ways). this has inspired me to address \n all of my issues like: rage/ and defense mode. if i can put my hands in the air and be like, youre right, i was wrong, i participated in harm/ it doesnt mean i need to be cast out of society. then we can start to grow and ultimately heal. im writing this post to share that ive discovered a less individualistic outlook since quitting alcohol. i believe our common suffering is more linked than i have felt before in the past. ive actually found so much support through 12 step programs/ meetup groups/ just relating based off of extricating this substance which i feel is so demonic. i encourage those who have taken the steps to heal from alcohol addiction to also confront deeper root issues and to be truly accountable. bc thats all we can really do, is be totally responsible for our actions and start to change the cycles that are ready to trap us through loops over and over again."}

{"author": "Ihateohioforever", "creation_date": "2018-05-07 06:46:07", "selftext": "I'll start this by saying I definitely fall into the category of emotional and mental disorders and alcohol was definitely used in self medication on top of being an alcoholic. Even before drinking, so childhood and teen years, I've dealt with undiagnosed anxiety and depression and possibly a sleep disorder. I know that's what's wrong because I just know without getting into specifics, a few addictions counselors from more than one point in my life reccomended that I look into actually seeing a psychiatrist to look into some of my other issues because they thought there could be more going on than just addictive behaviors. My mom was too poor and to religious to be able to afford to send me to a psychiatrist. Then at 19 I joined the Marine Corps and didn't want to get kicked out for mental health issues. So I self medicated with booze until eventually having to get alcohol counseling over some crazy shit I did while drunk on top of being put into a psych ward briefly. \n\nSo here it goes. I haven't smoked weed in years and while I was using it for self medication purposes I would have traded what weed would have done to me for what alcohol did to me anyday. \nI never liked getting super high, and while I did get in trouble for it in high school, I wasn't using it everyday and I would just be able to relax on it when I would get these massive anxiety attacks or shitty depression spells, no real issues aside from the fact that it was an illegal substance and a bit of memory loss. Now, Weed and AA's stance on it is one of the things that actually concerns me about my sobriety from alcohol, which I just started again 40 days ago. I definitely used alcohol because I'm an alcoholic. But I was also using alcohol to self medicate my other issues. I know I should probably see a psychiatrist However if I actually see a psychiatrist, like I probably should, they're probably going to want to put me on medications that have some really bad side effects and cost quite a bit of money and come with their own form of dependency as well that really isn't talked about enough or possibly weed. I think weed might actually be good for me from a medical standpoint. When I was younger and I smoked it was one of the few ways I could relax from my anxiety attacks or my depression spells, I didn't really like being really high, but just a bit for those issues. Granted weed isn't the greatest thing either and it does have its problems that come with it, but at the same time I just feel like I would have a better chance at staying away from alcohol with it than just doing the 12 steps, mainly because of how I used alcohol to self medicate a lot of my own issues with my mental health on top of being an alcoholic, but at the same time I would just be shunned from AA which is helping me to stay sober and probably the only way I won't destroy my life with alcohol, but weed might be the only way I don't lose my mind and relapse into alcohol anyway. Damned if I do damned if I don't. Anyways that's ok my mind right now.\n\nI should also say that neither of those two really led to each other. I used marijuana for a bit before I had my first drink, my first drink was not with weed, I only drank on weed once and it was the worst feeling in my life, when I was smoking weed for the second short lived period of time I wasn't drinking which was after my first experiences abusing alcohol and getting drunk."}
{"author": "CtrlAltDelLife", "creation_date": "2018-05-27 01:02:11", "selftext": "I almost made a throwaway, but I should just own this.\n\nUntil August 14, 2017 I was a daily drinker for 15 years.  I knew I was an alcoholic but I didn't care.  Like everyone else here I decided to sober up.  Literally every bad thing in my life was the result of drinking.  I wasted most of my 20s and 30s and I have to live with that.  The summary of what is going on with me is my alcoholism has shifted from daily drinking to binge drinking every couple months.\n\n\n\nThe pattern is always the same.  I quit, and after a couple days of feeling off, I feel good again.  I keep feeling better and better.  Its easy.  The ironic shit about that is its almost too easy.  When I start looking back at 50-60-70 days sober without it really being a struggle after day 2-3, the voice in my brain kicks in.  It tells me I'm a problem drinker that goes too far, but not really an alcoholic.  \n\n\n\"CtrlAltDelLife, alcoholics can't quit for months at a time like its no big deal!  Stop waffling between extremes and find some balance in your life!\"\n\n\nSo I do, and I end up on a binge for a week before I quit again and hate myself.  And the problem is I want to listen by that point.  I WANT to be able to go to happy hour after work once or twice a month.  I WANT to visit my family and sit with my aging dad on the back porch with a beer a few times a year.  I WANT those things back.  But that is not the reality of my mind and my body.  If I choose to be the person who can have those things, I'm choosing to give up and risk everything else.  I am much happier sober, and that leads me right back to giving in after a couple months when it starts to feel like, \"no big deal.\"  The fact I still romanticize it like that after a couple months isn't cool.\n\n\nThis time the cards really stacked well against me, and I saw it coming and did nothing to counter it.  In retrospect I planned this lapse.  I got a new job, a big raise, and a week off between jobs ending in a holiday weekend.  My wife loves me, but she doesn't drink and tends to follow my self assessments when I suggest these 2+ month stretches are a sign it, \"wasn't all that bad\", and \"I can be balanced.\"\n\n\nI have read/heard many times that the body and brains healing after long term alcohol abuse happens in some pretty pronounced phases.  2 of the big ones being 90 days and 6 months.  If that is the case I'm never even making it out of the first phase and I have no idea how good I may start to really feel.  I have also read/heard many times that relapsing after short duration of sobriety effectively reset the brain's healing back to day 1.  Not suggesting 60-70 days isn't good progress, but from a purely biological level its basically erased.\n\n\n\nI think it is time to legitimately try Smart or AA.  I need a continuous support system for when I start telling myself 2 months or more without any issues is proof of some bullshit.  When I romanticize the unmatched chilling out level and chemical euphoria that to be honest aren't even real.  I have avoided AA after some bad experiences in the past.\n\nI realize by typing that last bit I have sent out a telepathic signal that will summon Frank :)  But as I said, I'm going to try again because there are many different meetings and I live in a different part of the country now.  I need to find one that is right for me.\n\n\nThank you all for reading.  Lets try this again."}

I want *so badly* to feel that freedom from the hold alcohol has on me and to feel better again, but I'm still somehow clinging to the moderation option. I can recognize that I have a problem with alcohol, but for many years I've consoled myself with the fact that as long as I'm:\n--Not day drinking\n--Not hiding it at work at work in a coffee mug\n--Still able to control my drinking once I start\n--Haven't yet lost a job or had a DWI\n\nthen my problem isn't so bad yet and I don't yet have to stop, just drink less and less often.\n\nThing is..lately:\n\n--I do day drink. I finish whatever beer or wine is left as soon as I wake up. 7am? No problem. I'll finish up that bottle of wine.  I'll just start the next full day (except, I don't).\n--I do hide wine in my coffee mug at work. \n--I have driven drunk, and miraculously, haven't hurt myself or anyone else. I'm an especially lucky asshole.\n--I've skipped way too many \"dry\" events that I would normally enjoy because I've sunk into a miserable depression that feels almost insurmountable at this point.  The only thing that makes me feel less lonely is drinking.  Except it really doesn't.\n--I've ruined friendships and relationships, and it's even gotten to the point where even my boyfriend, my best friend and soulmate, is just sick of it all and has taken a huge step back. He can't handle me when I'm like this, he says.  He hasn't ended things, but I know the love and respect he had for me as a strong woman is now gone, bordering on a joke.\n\nAnd yet... I have a wedding coming up on Friday with open bar and I want to drink there. The bride and groom are people I met through the craft beer scene, are amazing people, and I really just want to enjoy myself one last time. Despite all the bad, there is that 5% of good times that I still cling on to, to justify it all.\n\nHow do you overcome this?  That as long as there's one good reason to drink even for 100 bad ones, that you'll still cling on?\n\nI've tried AA and it's not a good fit for me. \n\nThanks for listening, sd community~! "}

This first month was eye opening, I have never lasted that long before and I finally think I can keep on this way.\n\nThis community has been great and reading a lot of posts here have convinced me to attend a meeting. I was looking for an alternative to AA as I don't feel comfortable with the 12 steps program. I found something called smart recovery and I went to my first meeting yesterday. My hopes were not to high but I was still pretty disappointed.\n\nThere were about 12 guys \\(no females\\) , and more than 50&amp;#37; were new. I realised that some of them had to attend this meeting either by law ruling or because of a program they were checked in. That is not a big deal but kinda of puts in perspective the willingness of people to be there. All participants were, how do i put this nicely,  low condition people \\(yeah judge me if you like\\). I don't mind, no wait I do. I hoped for a more diverse public but that is the way it is and I can deal with that.  \n\nThe facilitator kept talking and talking. I mean at firs he was filling an empty space but the more the meeting went one the more it felt like he was having a therapy  :/ Within 1h30 of meeting, there was maybe 10 mn of actual sharing from participants.\n\nI was really triggered by the fact that the facilitator kept saying he could drink now. He doesn't have to be sober any more. He has been for years and he is not capable of having a beer or two. He said he was very cautious while doing so but it help felt really wrong to me.  I guess I am in the mood of never again and couldn't cope with 'be sober for a couple of years and you will be fine'. \n\nAnyway I am dedicated to this so I will give it another go next week and maybe another AA meeting a friend recommended to me as will to see if I fit more.  \n\nIWNDWYT"}

I want to be involved in this community, so I suppose nows as good a time as any!\n\nI've known I had a problem with alcohol for years. I've tried moderation, breaks, you know the drill. Last year I did Sober October and kept talking about how great it was and how much better I felt, but of course I drank EVERY DAY from November 1st to December 31st.\n\nI decided to finally do something about it to better myself, made the decision sometime in early December but kept drinking right up until New Years. I knew it would be challenging to do a year without alcohol, but I figured it would give me enough of a break to learn how to drink in moderation....\n\nWell, it's been a million times easier than I imagined, and I've grown and learned SO MUCH in the last few months. I still struggle with the idea of never drinking again, but I'm becoming more and more comfortable with it every day. I knew I needed to give myself a year, but I didn't know at the time that I needed the year to really reevaluate my relationship with alcohol. I kind of thought I would be white knuckling it a ton and counting down the days.

I'm slowly starting to accept that it's not. But I really truly feel like giving myself a year hard deadline with absolutely no alcohol was the best thing I could ever do for myself. I knew that if I said it and wrote it down, I could do it no problem. I didn't anticipate that I'd be doing so much reflection. I didn't anticipate that I would ever be comfortable and happy not drinking.\n\nI'm scared that the party goblin will win one of these days, but I know I've got a handle on it for the next 7 months, and I know I'll come here first when she starts getting loud in 2019, 2020, whenever it ends up being.\n\n\nTL; DR: My new years resolution is the only thing that made sobriety seem possible.

{"author": "vaporentportland", "creation_date": "2018-05-12 22:01:08", "selftext": "Hi folks,\n\nA quick synopsis: One month ago, I got the call that my brother who lived in Colorado (I live in Maine) had died suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack after riding his dirt bike. He was 49 years old. \n\n\nThe autopsy report showed extremely hardened arteries and a heart double its normal size. He had untreated RA, but he also smoked a pack a day for 30 years, didn't eat the healthiest diet and liked his whiskey. I wouldn't say he was an alcoholic, but he enjoyed getting a bit too drunk with his friends, which may have contributed to what I believe was largely a lifestyle-related death. \n\n\nIt has been the worst and hardest month of my life. We were very close, and I was fortunate to visit him just two months before he died, which makes this all the more haunting. I also lost my dad to a long, drawn-out serious of heart attacks when I was 16 (he was 72), but I'm 32 now and this seems different/way more in my face. \n\n\nA bit about me\u2014I have struggled with alcohol dependence since my early twenties. Yes, I like to overdo it a bit when we're all having fun, but for me, alcohol is what I've used to treat my underlying anxiety disorder for the better part of my life. Not the kind of thing where I'm waking up to a bottle, but more once I start drinking, it makes me feel \"normal\" and I have an incredibly hard time stopping. It can sometimes turn into 10 drinks throughout a given 24 hour period, though usually more like 3-5. \n\n\nNeedless to say, I have had a few near blackout nights since my brother's death and have been using alcohol as my primary coping mechanism. It got to the point where when I met my fiance after work last night (she works until 10pm), I could barely speak without slurring. She is not impressed and will no longer put up with this\u2014I don't blame her. \n\n\nI'm ready to make major changes in my life. I don't know if a life completely without alcohol is in my future\u2014it may be, though I would prefer a drastically altered relationship with alcohol as an alternative\u2014but I know right now, that's likely what has to happen. AA is something that I would prefer to avoid (please do not judge me for this), though I'm willing to potentially give it a shot. I'm also not looking for drugs as replacements; marijuana, for example, is something that I enjoy a lot but does not scratch the itch of alcohol, and as far as benzos/antidepressants go, been there, done that, not good for me.\n\n\nI guess I'm just looking for any/all thoughts as to how I can take this immense tragedy in my life and reap at least a small form of silver lining from it. I know that I need to be there for my mom who is 76 and lost her son, and I know I need to be there for my fiance who wants to start a family with me and move forward in the wake of this awful experience. \n\n\nThank you all in advance.

You probably know where this is going already. I didn't even make it out of the parking lot before side swiping a car driving in the opposite lane. I'm assuming you all know the rules, if you're drunk and there's an accident you're getting picked up.

I gave myself permission to do a seven-day at home detox wherein I wouldn't expect too much from myself. That time is up. I had a pretty bad setback yesterday involving both career and someone I'd once seen as a romantic interest (he's in my field) and was (very briefly) tempted to drink but I didn't. I thought to myself: no matter what, this is not going to fuck with my sobriety. So I cancelled plans I'd made with a friend to go on a walk and get coffee to just stay at home and be in bed. Today I feel much the same. I just want to be in bed, I don't want to get up and run errands. I work freelance so I don't have to be anywhere, and am basically taking a semi-leave of absence anyway. My question is: how do you know if you're taking it too easy? I know you're supposed to be selfish in early sobriety, but I'm not yet prepared to see people I used to drink a lot with, even though they have said they won't drink with me and support my decision. I feel depressed and worthless, and know that taking care of errands or even chores will probably make me feel less bad (my apartment looks like something out of Trainspotting), but I feel super tired and down and for right now, being sober by itself feels like such a big deal (before this 9 days sober, 1-2 days sober max had been the longest I'd gone for at least 6 years), that I'm inclined to give myself a little more time. But when do I know if this is just me being lazy, and how \"true\" is my sobriety if it isn't even being tested in social situations? Am I using sobriety as an excuse not to do anything, or is that still ok at this stage? I feel like I'm moving really slowly and that the rest of the world is getting on with its life and its business, excelling and moving forward, while I'm just languishing here. "}

As many on this sub I only drank to get drunk and I loved drinking alone since it would mean I don't have to carry on conversations. I would just watch YouTube and get wasted.\n\nI started drinking only when I went to study to a different country. I was so happy I escaped the control of my relatively strict parents, I just went wild for a while. Then my drinking got more casual (or so I thought). In reality I always went overboard at least once a month, cause I \"had to\" numb myself and forget about reality. Preferably without my best friend/roommate knowing about it since she hated seeing me drunk.\n\nThen fast forward a couple years I changed career and found a stable job along with a new group of heavy drinking friends who were a bit older than me. And I kinda looked up to them, I thought that they were cool adults and I really wanted to fit in. On the first night I met them, I drank a lot of shots with them and eventually threw up and fell asleep in the bathroom. They called me an uber, the driver had to stop multiple times for me to vomit on the road. I was super embarrassed the next day but they told me it happens, no big deal.\n\nEvery time after that when I was hanging out with them, I tried to control myself but I wasn't satisfied with just being tipsy. At some point I started buying booze on the way home and getting \"properly\" hammered on my own. Or just going to the office on the weekend and drinking beer all day long there (we don't have cameras or security).\n\nFast forward a couple months, we have a team building event at work at a pension out of town. Booze is free, so I drink everything I can get my hands on, then dance and blackout. In the morning I'm not hungover but can't step on the left foot. Turns out I fell while dancing and badly sprained my ankle, my colleagues had to carry me to the room. Super embarrassing. After that they drove me home and I stayed in bed for a week. Guess what, it's been 6 months and it still hurts and I still limp around. Injury #1.\n\nThen my heavy drinking friends invited me for an outdoor pagan holiday which basically means getting drunk all day guilty free. I was excited, bought some good vodka which we drank at like 11 am along with beer and mimosas. Then the whole day got blurry, at some point I was offered a sip of hard liquor and drank the whole bottle instead. At night we went to a restaurant where I blacked out and fell sleep on the table a few times but refused to stop drinking. After that my good friend didn't talk to me for a week and my roommate (same one) got really worried so I promised both of them that I won't drink hard stuff and never make fool of myself again. \n\nOf course I broke the promise that same month. But I was behaving well (meaning not causing any big trouble), so it was \"fine\". Also somewhere along the way I built my tolerance and stopped vomiting after shots.\n\nNow comes the last event. Two weeks ago we went to a one of my friends' country house to party hard. I drank a lot of vodka on the first day and on the second we only had beer so I was kinda bummed and went to bed early. Then comes the last night and I buy vodka as a gift for a friend at home but decide to share it with everyone. Then I'm offered acid and of course I take it. They buy more beer, I buy more vodka. We get to cottage, I start drinking and talking about linguistics and black out. \n\nI woke up without hangover and found a dirty bucket near my bed. I was wearing my friend's shirt. No one really filled me in, pretending nothing happened. We went back home and I felt pain near my heart, I couldn't take a deep breath or move without pain. I got scared and started google search on signs of alcoholism and found this sub. After a few days my friend told me, that I was having a bad trip that night and went to the woods on my own in the middle of the night. My friends found me and dragged me to the cottage and put me to bed. I started vomiting in my sleep, they had to sit near me whole night cause I couldn't stop vomiting. I have zero memory of it.\n\nMy chest still hurts and I have a big bruise on my back. That's injury #2. After that trip I decided to stop drinking. I have yet to tell those friends about it, but I'm determined to get sober.\n\nAlso last night I watched Eurovision with a different group of people, they had some wine and cocktails, I was drinking water with lime and mint. A girl was sitting next to me, she was already drunk but kept drinking, talking and saying sorry for everything she said. I recognized myself in that girl. I would get hammered last night if it wasn't for this sub. \n\nThank you everyone and I won't drink with you today."}

I was 30 when I started drinking 2 bottles of wine a night. I\u2019d go out with girlfriends and could put back 12 cocktails without a problem. And then drive home. \n\nI\u2019ve been in 2 hit and run accidents. One where I clipped a guys back fender (he took off too, it was a Friday night so probably drunk as well) and the other was when I barely tapped the rear end of the person in front of me. I am deeply ashamed and can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t go to jail. \n\nHere I am, at 39, finally serious about getting sober and I AM SO SCARED. The longest I\u2019ve gone without drinking in the past 3 years was 17 days. In the past 1.5 years I switched from my big bottle of wine, to finishing a box in 2 days, to hard alcohol. McCormick vodka to be exact. Yeah the good stuff. /s\n\nIn January, things really started going south. I was getting blackout drunk regularly. I had started getting violent with my boyfriend in the months prior. End of January, boyfriend comes home and I\u2019m passed out. The next thing I know,  I am grabbing him by the hair and trying to wrestle him into the bathtub. He was able to restrain me after a pretty long struggle. Long story short, things got quite ugly. He went to jail. I didn\u2019t. But I should have as well. I later found out that I had punched him in the face multiple times. His mugshot shows his face is all bruised and bloody. It was a low time for us. \n\nHe\u2019s since quit drinking with no issues. I continued to hide my drinking. I\u2019d go to work drunk and get sent home. Many times. I no call/no showed a total of 15 times this year alone and they still let me stay. It was the best job I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019d found my tribe. They knew I have a problem. One month ago, after a day and night of drinking a couple pints of vodka, I went in and told my boss that I had to quit. Right then and there. It was a stupid impulsive thing. But I just couldn\u2019t do my job anymore because I was always drunk. In my drunken stupor, I had decided that I was going to move an hour away to a relatives house in the country and get my head on straight. \n\nYou know what I did instead? I went on a bender. I had some \u201clighter\u201d drinking days here and there. But I\u2019ve been mostly drunk or passed out since the beginning of April. The past 2 weeks I\u2019ve been in the darkest place I\u2019ve ever been. I quit showering. Eating. I couldn\u2019t leave the house. Just sat on my couch drinking my vodka and shoving the empty bottles under the couch, walking to the store to get more. Repeat. Repeat. \n\nI called my ex husband to take me to the ER to detox. I blew a .27 and begged them to help me. They sent me home. A few days later, I went to the rehab down the road. THEY sent me home! I spent a few more days on my couch. I called the suicide hotline. I called around in circles to different treatment places. No one could help me. \n\nLuckily I have an Rx for Valium. So I packed up and went to stay with my mom for a few days. I couldn\u2019t stand to be alone. I knew I would continue drinking. I knew something bad was going to happen. I spent 3 days there and should have stayed longer but I just wanted to be home. To go to meetings (mom lives in the sticks, no close meetings). I was already going to them before, unfortunately while drunk still. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is all over the place. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve said anything inappropriate. I am just so anxious. I\u2019ve hardly slept. I\u2019m excited to actually do this and work the steps. I\u2019m terrified to actually BE with myself. I\u2019ve always been a very anxious person AND I have horrible tinnitus, both of these things I have masked with alcohol for years. And now I have to deal with it. And it\u2019s driving me crazy. It\u2019s so tempting to just go buy a bottle but then it\u2019ll just put me back at square 1. Every little pain or weird thing my body does I\u2019m going \u201coh no I\u2019m dying\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s no real point to this post. I\u2019m sure I can go on and on and on.

I have given myself 2 days to get past the initial anger and this is the right thing. Still HARD though!!  We have been together 2 years and no one makes me laugh like him.  I love him. We  always have the best time playing together (games, political discussions, camping). My sobriety has lessened this, for sure, but not entirely - I still enjoy his company. He is a \"happy drunk.\" However, no intimacy for over 8mo. His drinking is responsible for only 80% of that. I think he is just asexual and I gave up trying. So, we have been buddies for a long time anyway...why is it so hard to put the period on it? In my sobriety, I have noticed this about our relationship: we rarely go anywhere  so he can continue drinking, I have to be the dd any time we do, I can never go over to his house after 6:30pm and expect coherent conversation, seeing him with a glass of scotch at 8am (Saturday) doesn't shock me at all, he may be hard of hearing, but DAMN! drunk people are annoying as hell to talk too. He has never lied to me about who he is. He told me right off that he was set in his ways and was \"unlikely to change.\" I chose to go all in and increase my drinking to match his. I chose to stay all these months in the hopes that I could change his mind and we would marry. I am so glad I didn't and we did not. I wonder if he were to get sober, would that make everything ok? Is it really just the alcohol that is the problem? I have no idea, because I really have no idea who is is without it. I have been a widow for 5.5 yrs and had enjoyed a 22 yr relationship with my husband. Rarely ever drank during those years. I feel like, I am coming back into that person. The desperate desire to be married again has faded with my sobriety. My visions of future family gatherings no longer require me being married. Oh, I will date. Don't get me wrong! Just not feeling like marriage is necessary anymore. Closing on a new (to me) house today, the first I have ever owned by myself, as a proof!

For the 5 days before that I had continued my standard drinking schedule of 4-10 high ABV beers a night. The day before I stopped drinking I went to a wine and wreath making class with my girlfriend at the time, had a few glasses of wine to take the fog of my hangover away, and then went home where I continued to drink (pretty much abandoning my girlfriend even though she wanted to keep hanging out but I needed time to \"relax\"). The next morning I woke up and told myself for the that I needed to quit drinking. I had told myself that countless times for the past couple of years. I knew something needed to change but never figured out how to do it. I would white-knuckle it for a week or two but then I'd give in and start drinking again.\n\nThe only thing different on the day I stopped drinking was that I started participating on this sub. I had lurked occasionally when I was drunk since visiting this sub made me super anxious but that day I just decided to start reading some posts. I read and read and decided I would try the daily check-in the next day. I kept doing those check-ins and eventually I heard about This Naked Mind by Annie Grace and read that. It really helped reshape the way I thought about alcohol and eventually I passed that two week sober mark. This was huge for me. I couldn't even remember the last time I was sober that long before since I was 20.\n\nLife has certainly had it's ups and downs. The shitty days and the happy days can oddly enough both make you want to turn back to alcohol. My girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me was tough, I was so mad and hurt that I almost didn't see the point of continuing my sobriety. This sub helped me see thru that. My sister's wedding where everyone was happy and having a good time and drinking was almost more difficult for me somehow. I had cravings I hadn't felt in over a year. But I pushed through and told myself I would just make it through that day. \n\nIt's hard to believe that I started this journey two years ago. When I started, going such a long time sober seemed utterly and miserably impossible. This sub has helped me through the good and bad days and given me the tools and support to be the sober person I truly want to be. Thank you!"}

{"author": "HydroBear", "creation_date": "2018-05-12 11:46:46", "selftext": "A quick backstory here, I won't bore you all with the extreme details. \n\nI began drinking when I was 14. All throughout high school and indeed the first two years of college, I regularly indulged, but overall I didn't do it to excess but maybe 4-6 times a year. Teenagers do that. Before 18 I was maybe blacked-out twice. It is important to add that during this time I was very socially aware. Anxiety? That's what **other people** get. I had no difficulties in social situations, with friends, with girls. Then in my sophomore year of college, it changed. I wanted to kill that bar, or my friend's alcohol supply. Instead of a reset button that it was for so many years, alcohol became a challenge. Give me a beer, I'll drink eleven of them just out of spite. \n\nThis continued throughout college, and slowly and surely I realized that my ability to socialize without alcohol was changing.... but that was okay, as long as I could socialize during drinking.... right? No. While I was never a chronic drinker, I took my sparse, sporadic drinking to more extremes. I killed relationships, friendships. I've probably been absolutely blacked-out, beyond all recognition (problem was, I never passed out) 40+ times. \n\nTwo years ago I ended another very close relationship with my binge drinking. I got black-out drunk. I remember nothing of it. I quit, relapsed, and quit again seven months ago.\n\nAll has been good. I can go to the bars with my wife and friends and live vicariously through them. I truly enjoy watching them have fun while I sip Red Bulls and drive them around town as a cheuffeur. I enjoy spending time with family while they drink because of the stories that come from it. I enjoy going to restaurants while my friends/wife are drinking and have crazy conversations. \n\nI thought my sobriety was going well, until I realized that my social anxiety outside of this small group of friends and my wife and a very few select members of my family had completely collapsed. I've never felt this kind of anxiety before. It's completely crippling, and as of the last two months, it's infected my friends group as well. I can't read people as well as I used to, I take offense to small slights, and I worry constantly about what I'm going to say. \n\nTonight, for example, some friends and I went to the bar to celebrate a big event in our lives (I graduated with my second degree). We went to one bar, it was fine, and then at the second bar everyone started mingling with other groups.... and I fucking fell apart. Not being able to drink made it so that I could not replace the false social awareness I once had with ones that were natural. I could not mingle with classmates, yet again, I could not mingle with their friends, I could not mingle with my own friends, I even wanted to be away from my wife. \n\nAnd it didn't just happen tonight. Two weeks ago it happened at a dinner function with classmates and professionals. And it's happened periodically over the last couple months in classes, at family functions, with my own brothers and sisters. No matter where I am, surrounded by alcohol or not surrounded by alcohol, I find myself having such difficulty with social interactions now. I get angry over things, I overreact to things, I find myself questioning my own personality. \n\nThing is, years ago I was at a point where I was able to mingle and complete these interactions without alcohol. Now, I cannot reclaim that. Does this happen to people after getting sober? Is it odd that it's happening to someone who was a binge alcoholic vs. a chronic alcoholic? How can I begin moving forward to reclaim who I once was? \n\nSeven months, but these last two months have been torture. Not that I want to return to drinking, necessarily, it very nearly ruined my life....  but that I can't figure out how to create feelings of happiness and regain my composure because so many of my recent years I **replaced** these skills with alcohol.... how do I become the Hydrobear I once was without alcohol? What are others' experiences in this realm?  \n\n(I will generally disregard any posts stating to avoid bars. That's not what I'm trying to figure out. The fact that these things happen in both non-drinking and drinking settings frightens me. That example was just the most recent of my failure to thrive socially with my sobriety, and what drove me to write this tonight. The dinner (with no alcohol, as it was a professional dinner), was also similar--something set off my anxiety and I wasn't able to climb back during it). "}

We talked about drinking early on in our relationship and decided we saw too much negative in drinking and we generally don't drink.  Socially maybe every other month.  However part of that has been with our neighbor, one of my friends who is a hard core alcoholic.  Hard. Core.  She drinks all night, sleeps till 5 or 6 pm.  Her spouse is very unhappy and I know from our private conversations that dumping her is on the table, but she has invested so much, she is reluctant to pull the trigger.\n\nSkip ahead, I am becoming bothered by the fact she texts my spouse (he's a gay man, she's a lesbian) at 3AM to come drinking.  Not that anything came of it as he slept through it, but I am bothered by the fact she thought it was appropriate.  We are neighbors, which kind of exacerbates this.\n\nLast weekend she texted at 1AM when we were still awake, but I still think this was not something \"decent\" people should do.  It had been a month since we had anything to drink so I begrudgingly said let's go, he ended up staying and drinking till 10AM.\n\nI feel like she wants to groom him to be her drinking buddy.

I am considering saying we can't socialize with them any more because you can't ask an alcoholic to be responsible with alcohol in any way, certainly not because it will harm someone else.  This has blindsided me, though it's not truly a problem yet, it's bothering me a lot.  I hate to end a marriage in short order, but I won't have alcohol be a point of contention in my marriage.  I now it's futile.  He has never drunk enough to really crave it or have a routine, but when it's around and he's started, he only wants more.  Nothing matters.  For that reason we simply don't drink and he doesn't miss it as long as he hasn't started, but multiple texts offering it can make a difference, especially if they are well-timed on a weekend.\n\nDo any recovered alcoholics have input?

The world is no longer spinning too fast, anxiety and depression is reduced.\n\n\n**10-18 days:** Making amends with my family and they\u2019re being very supportive. I realise they don\u2019t hate ME; they hate who I become when I drink. I hate that guy, too. We can laugh and joke a little. I get a part in a play because I\u2019m sober and can write an email and plan some things. I attend 2 AA meetings this week. I love AA now. It\u2019s exciting to go and just shoot the shit with people who understand.\n\n\n**19-25 days:** People are commenting how I\u2019m much happier I am. My sleep is so much better. I doze off easily and wake to the alarm. Jesus, who would have thought sleeping like a normal person would be so wonderful?! I went on my first date sober. It was the best first date I\u2019ve had. She knows I\u2019ve quit drinking. We kissed at the end of the night and have made plans for when she\u2019s here next (She lives in North Wales, I\u2019m in Liverpool). I am killing it in the gym.\n\n\n**26-30 days:** People feel they can now rely on me for things, like to cover their work shift or lend a hand. My mum sent me a wonderful text \u201cYou\u2019re in such a great place right now, and it makes me so happy to see. I love you. I am proud of you. Keep it up.\u201d Women are smiling at me. Am I handsome now? Life has returned to my eyes, my soul is back. I can look at myself in the mirror and smile.\n\n\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been easy and the road isn\u2019t always smooth. I recognise factors which trigger urges and avoid them and people. I\u2019ve got a great network of supportive friends and family, my AA group, and stopdrinking.

I think I'm going to make this post shorter, but I promise I'm in good spirits! \n\nFirst, can we talk about PAWS? I have been told from my therapist that is what I have. Adhedonia is a word I've also researched that I think applies. Just feeling aggravated by everything, and waves of depression will hit. When I am in a good mood, it's so great...but it feels fragile. Moods aside, my mind cannot stop racing about my mental stability at this moment. \n\nI guess I just assumed I would not experience PAWS because I was drinking beer/wine and only at night in binges. I was not physically dependent in that I constantly needed to be inebriated, but I was emotionally dependent in the sense that I was living a life that centered around alcohol and nothing else ... at least in terms of meaning. \n\nSecondly, I just want to send a message to young people on here. I started drinking at 20. I'm 28. There was 2.5 years of recovery/sobriety in between. This has felt like a saga...it feels like it's been 20 years...so many highs, but so many lows and times where I could have ruined my life. \n\nBut, if I get through this all the way again and take me recovered self seriously...I'll end up having been a drunk just 5.5 out of how many years I live my life. \n\n...HOLY...F%$&amp;. It really gets me to think about that. How much longer I've got to go, and how many opportunities there are ahead for me to life an amazing, long, fulfilling life!! \n\nI guess I'm focusing on that happy nugget right now because the last month or so has been tough. I want to feel like myself again. I am thinking like myself...I'm being positive. I have energy. I'm running every day and working toward my goals. But my brain just feels funky. \n\nAnyway, much love to every single one of you. "}

Nobody noticed that my soda &amp; bitters wasn't a \"real drink\", and I realized that I enjoyed that night much more sober than I would have two or three beers in.

I felt more present, more in the moment, and I'll certainly remember it better! They were all quite relieved when they realized they had somebody who could drive at the end of the night when they didn't plan well for it. My former alcoholic self even came in handy when they were trying to determine who was \"good to drive\" as part of my brain had been religiously keeping track of all the alcohol in the room and who drank which glasses when. And seeing them all get inebriated certainly made me glad that I wasn't acting the way some of them were : ). The friend coming through town was somebody who used to sort of be an idol of mine, who is about 10 years older than me, and now seeing them struggling with smoker's cough, I was very glad I had kicked that habit as well.\n\nAnyways, if somebody is reading this and facing an upcoming social event, worried that they'll feel out of place or enjoy it less, hopefully this can help ease your concerns. IWNDWYT.\n\nEdit: I can see how the above sentence might seem like enabling or encouraging people to go out with people drinking and put their sobriety at risk, this is absolutely not my intent. If you are avoiding or anxious about a social event because you are worried you'll end up with a drink in your hand, please place your sobriety first. This is just some encouragement for those who are sure they can handle the not drinking part and are just worried about the social aspects. Dry People/Places is great advice and really important to a lot of people in recovery and I don't mean to be encouraging people to break that if it's a part of their recovery journey."}

You and the kids are better off without me. I will not divorce you because you need my workplace benefits and access to my money, but if you want a divorce you need to file.\" He said he bought a bottle drank 4 shots and threw the rest out.

I spent those 72 hours really deciding whether I wanted to die or give recovery an honest go.\n\nMy friend picked me up from the psychward on the condition that I attend 1 meeting a day \\(he had spent those 72 hours speaking to doctors, counselors and AA\\) and took me from the hospital straight to a meeting. I've gone from hating AA to looking forward to it. I let my ego go and asked for help.\n\nMy life has gotten better 10 fold since I made that decision.

I never thought I could get here though and want others to know that you CAN do it.\n\nDespite how many mistakes you\u2019ve made, how many bad situations you\u2019ve been in, how many people you\u2019ve hurt and how many of those nights you \u2018don\u2019t want to think about\u2019 - there is always time and a way to make amends. You can be that person who changes others opinions of you and you can change your relationship with alcohol for the better.\n\nSlip ups may happen, it might take time, but you can genuinely change the way you feel about and see alcohol in your life. I never thought I could but I did!\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up for those past indiscretions. People may also take time to see you differently and that\u2019s ok.\nJust know that you can make the choice, today, tomorrow or next week. You can choose everyday to try to tackle it again and every step you take is in the right direction.\"\n\nBig love,\u00a0\nAnonymous Hello Sunday Morning member\n\n\n"}

When I first thought about quitting drinking, I figured I had it under control enough that my wish for sobriety was as easy as hitting a field goal from the 20 yard line. I could do it whenever I wanted, so why not enjoy myself a little more before I do?\n\nAnd after months and even years now of making excuses like \u201cAfter the holidays. Or my best friends going to Afghanistan. Or the girl friend broke up with me.\u201d All these seemed valid enough reasons for me to keep drinking. Just one more time, just one more week then I\u2019ll kick that field goal of sobriety. Except what I didn\u2019t realize was how far I had let myself get pushed down the field. It was no longer a 20 yard shoe-in but a 55 yard boot to reach sobriety. \n\nThen one day a few months ago I kicked that sucker, and I nailed it. 60 days of sobriety. No problem. I went to parties, had all the usual stressors and valid enough reasons to drink, but I said no to them all. So about a month ago I think to myself, what the hell I made that field goal once I\u2019ll make it again when I have to. IF I have to.\n\nAnd just like that I was drinking again, telling myself that I was the Adam Vinatieri of sobriety and that whenever I truly wanted to be sober it was just one quick kick away. \n\nWell I was wrong, of course. And I guess you could say I\u2019ve missed the past few dozen kicks. I realized I can\u2019t just boot the 60 yarder like I did. I got lucky. I have to start healthy habits that move me closer to making that kick and not having to try to do it again. An AA meeting, telling a close friend I\u2019m trying to quit. Reading a dozen posts on this sub. All this will lead me closer to the goal posts instead of each drink and each rationalization that only push me further away. "}

Since then I've been back to the old struggle of telling myself I can control my drinking only to spin into a binge within a few days, swear booze off, and start the cycle of self compromising all over again.\n\nLast week I really thought I had it figured out. As long as I went for a long run every day I could have two beers with dinner to finish out the day. As always, this ended in a weekend bender. I woke up this morning - not necessarily with a hangover - but this overwhelming sense of dread and darkness. I couldn't get out of my apartment. I called in sick and just sort of rode through hours of really horrible anxiety.\n\nIt's 10:00PM now, and even though I'm still a little wobbly, I'm not going to drink today, and know that tomorrow will be easier, but that the need for self vigilance will begin all over again.\n\nI've said it before, but I can't keep going on this way. It's going to fuck up my life. My year and a half of sobriety was incredible, but getting back into that rhythm has proven very difficult.\n\nI need to rethink how I'm going to stay sober. I need to take proactive steps if I'm going to make it for the long haul. \n\nWhat I really want to do is go to an AA meeting, but for the next two days I have some really hectic travel coming up. In the short term I'm going to check in here. This is an incredible resource that I've only occasionally and passively taken advantage of. Come Thursday, I should be able to start hitting the rooms, but I need to have some sort of plan to get through the next few days.\n\nSorry this post was a bit of a ramble. Any tips you might have would be appreciated. At least I got through today. Thanks."}

The last couple of months I've started to think I may have a problem with alcohol and would appreciate some input.\n\nTo begin, I rarely crave alcohol. I can go weeks without a drop and it doesn't bother me. I am fine going for a couple of drinks; a pint or two at the pub and I'm ok. I've even been on boozy dates where I've had a maybe 3/4 and I can handle that fine.\n\nThe problem seems to be when I go on a 'proper' night out, i.e. when I go out with intention of bar-hopping / clubbing. 5 pints seems to be the point of no return; after that I just want to drink and drink and drink. I start to feel the buzz and want more and more. This has, unfortunately, led to many hazy nights and often black outs over the years. \n\nI resent the embarrassment the following morning when a friend says to me \"Do you remember doing X last night?!\" Nope, can't say I do! I've thankfully (not yet) done anything completely outrageous or lost friends as a result of my drinking, but I have been obnoxious in the past. This has resulted in me being thrown out of bars/clubs on a few occasions.\n\nI enjoy drinking, and I like the feeling of being drunk (but not black out drunk!) and don't want to cut alcohol out of my life. However, I have two questions to ask:\n\n1. Based on what I have said, do you think I have some sort of problem with alcohol?\n\n2. Is there anything I can do to stop myself from buying \"just one more drink\"?\n\nSorry for my rambling. I appreciate any advice / thoughts you can share with me. :) "}

In AA, they talk about a point where one can no longer live with or without alcohol, and I had forgotten from years before what that looked like. I had been sober for nearly two years before, and yet I left my personal health unchecked. Resentments over breakups, feeling cut out of my normal circles, and neglecting to walk the walk that i was talking led me out the door, to stay out for eight long months. In that time, I was shown through my drinking that it wasn't long before I was back to the point before I was first introduced to the program. I'm also diagnosed Bipolar II, and during the whole time sober and out the last go around, i left it unmedicated with no real structure to stick to. That alone is a nightmare to deal with, even before i introduce alcohol. \n\nOne of the worst feelings in the world in my experience is a manic episode left unchecked. That first week of being sober again was agony. I had hit about five days dry when that manic episode hit. My mind raced so quickly of thoughts and feelings of pure misery, I wanted nothing more than to just stop the thinking for good. I was prepared for it too. I was going to to to my local late night meeting, set up a noose, and hang myself when I got home. I sat through that meeting for a good half hour mulling over final preparations, until it hit me: I have something wrong with me that AA alone can't fix, and that i needed help. Luckily I had reached out to a friend that was at that meeting with me and explained to him that I needed to go get some psychiatric care. I actually had the chamce to thank him the other day, and that was tear jerking for me.\n\nIt was there i got some more of the proper treatment that i needed. I was given medication to help with the mood swings, and I was well off until I decided that I didn't need meds anymore. I had stopped in February of 2017 and went along like i was fine. That worked until it didn't. In the next 12 month's that followed, I had made more calls to the National Suicide Hotline than I cared to admit. I had to face again that I am still in need of medication and help from professionals to be better in general.\n\nI recently celebrated my 27th birthday at the end of last month, and it was then I decided to really get serious about my mental health. For someone like me, my mental health and my sobriety will always work in tandem. One doesn't supersede the other. I cannot have one without the other. Its a scary experience for sure, but I can't wait to see what's on the other side of this. I apologize if I rambled a little. Its just something that was on my mind. "}

That was the critical moment- where I could have called someone. Instead, numb, I made a beeline for the store and bought two bottles of sparkling rose with a label called \u201cWish Flower\u201d. Pink and innocent looking. Pushed any thoughts of stopping clear out of my head, convinced myself that no one had to know, just me and lord knows I\u2019m up for carrying more shame.\nGot home and immediately popped a bottle and chugged the first 2 glasses. Who chugs wine on an empty stomach? An alcoholic. Took my two bottles to sit in front of my tv screen and played my drunk \u201cescape\u201d video game: Dragon Age Inquisition. I love being an elf. It felt great for about 20 minutes and then I don\u2019t remember much after that.\nFast forward, husband comes home and I\u2019m in bed, passed out. Apparently I tried hiding the evidence by taking the recycling out but I left our recycling bag with the two bottles. He also found a wine stopper next to me on our bed stand and my breath reeked of booze. I know, totally inconspicuous.\nHe told me to get back up on the sobriety horse and keep going.

Through dedicated effort I'm in a much better place further down the road in my recovery and I think I'm finally at a point where: a) I have a happy social life full of people that I love and who care about my well-being (although in rare moments I forget that), but more importantly b) I'd truly rather be alone and sober than with people and drunk. \n\nFor people who are sitting alone on reddit tonight in early recovery know that I'm thinking of you-Just trust that it gets better, trust that you'll meet or reconnect with friends who support a healthier lifestyle for you if that's something you're struggling with, and trust that you'll get to the point where time spent by yourself isn't all urges to drink, and negative emotions.\n\nSober living is happy living, and even today, which was one of the tougher days for me in a long time, was better than just about everyday I spent drunk, because everyday I spent drunk was a day spent pushing the people who cared about me, and a day spent bringing myself one step closer to an early death.

And it is that, of course. But it is also so... normal, I guess. And therein lies an issue I've found quite challenging - being alone.\n\nI don't mind it though, and generally really need it in order to recharge being more introverted and working in a highly social profession. However, since adolescence I pretty much suffered from fear of social situations and learned to be social with alcohol - it was common where I live to get buzzed and/or drunk during weekends, and in my twenties after work etc etc. Basically I socialized my formative adult years constantly buzzed. I probably was a high functioning alcoholic already 10 years ago.\n\nAnyway, as many with a bit more sober time under their belts probably have experienced, not drinking is/can be a very solitary road, especially if one doesn't attend AA meetings or SMART recovery stuff. And if you're in your mid-thirties, as I am.  AA isn't for me and there is no SMART recovery program in my country. Most of my friends, the real ones, have families and/or relationships and while meeting new people is relatively easy for me due to the social skills I've developed from my work, getting to know them and staying in contact seems like hard work. Often quite one-sided, too, as people tend to have their networks \"full\", in a sense.\n\nAand then there's the dating aspect. I've had a couple experiences, both nice as they were and unrelated to any bar activities etc. But I don't really know if I should pursue that either as I am kind of figuring out who I actually am at the moment (going to therapy, dealing with anxiety/depression &amp; past traumas) and I kind of feel that any emotional blows might be a risk to my sobriety. But I really crave for connection at the same time. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is whether anyone has had similar experiences and how did you (or did you) solve this dilemma? Did you set a \"sober time frame\" for dating? "}

I know now that I have never had a better time than those last months; I am my own master, reasonable, healthy, calm, friendly; and finally free of permanent guilt! I am conscious, I actively feel the good and the bad in my life, I meditate, I go to AA and other group meetings regularly and this enriches everything I am. I *never* want to go back to who and where I was when I was drinking. I was quite lucky to be able to stop cold turkey and not once have had a drink since, and rarely any cravings. I am in many ways in peace with my own existence, I am happy that I became from an drinker to an recovering alcoholic.\n\nBut still it never stops: Sometimes, there is a voice in my head, my own voice, and it tells me things like: \u2018Tonight, you could have a few glasses, man. There is nobody home and you might relax a bit better, maybe see the movie a bit deeper or feel the music a bit more intense. If you don\u2019t overdo it, you\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\n\nAnd I know, the voice is right! The music does touch me deeper when I am pissed and the movie is more interesting in that moment.

And for sure, I will overdo it. Of course! Sooner or later. If not this time, then next time. Which will inevitably come when I start again today. I will hurt myself or break my phone, yell in McDonald\u2019s or start a fight with the police. My wife will immediately know and my kids will be endlessly disappointed.

I know all the good things about not drinking. But I have to actively make an effort to tell them to myself. The voice though, it comes by itself. It pretends to be me, be my friend. When in a good mood, I can laugh about it, because I know how absurd it would be: I cannot drink \u2018a little\u2019. Or \u2018only today\u2019. And what alcoholic wants to drink \u20182 or 3 beer only\u2019, anyway? \n\nI did so many stupid things while drunk, it\u2019s a surprise I can sit here and write this, with my head, my limbs and all my organs still intact, with a family that supports me and a job that pays our bills well. I am thankful for this and of course I can only feel this grateful since I stopped drinking. If I was drinking I would be rude, rough and feel entitled and I\u2019d give a shit about thankfulness.\n\nBut I want to stay happy. And because I know how it is going to end, I will not drink. I will not end this beautiful life without drama, without hangovers, fear, anxiety and regret. There is no end in sight for this, although this voice never seems to fully disappear. I hear it, but I will not listen to it. \n\nI will not drink with you today."}

Crazy thing is that I really haven't had an urge to drink and I know that I'm not going to. I just can't help but  wonder if this is just a normally stressful day or if there's a hole there, because I know in the back of my mind that I would normally be drinking right now.\n\nI suppose I know that this is just what stress and overwhelming feel like when you're not using alcohol as a coping mechanism. I know I need to just feel it and address why I actually feel the things that I do, but damn if that doesn't seem rough when my old way is gone.\n\nThing is, I've had fleeting thoughts lately about what catastrophe will feel like when I am sober. I generally handle stress very well, even outside of drinking. However, anytime it was particularly bad, I would definitely drink. When my dad died last year, I probably drank for two weeks straight.

I was definitely that person also  encouraging others to drink to stay with me In the infectious nature of alcohol and now that I'm fighting so hard to recover I'm like WOW i get it.

It's the reason why I didn't do well in high school (my school gave out laptops to the students...yeah...) I wasted many days of childhood watching TV shows I didn't really care about. I've wasted many gorgeous days. The funny thing is, I don't even tend to do stuff I *actually like* on screens, like playing video games or watching cartoons. It's doing fuck all on the internet. \n\nIt's usually to avoid something. Now, studying and laundry.\n\nI was slightly more successful at getting my shit together last semester after drinking so much I failed a year of school. I still lollygagged on the internet a lot last semester, and I drank too much (2-3 glasses of wine most nights) but I did things that were good for me, like schoolwork and exercise.\n\nI KNOW what to do. I know Pomodoro-ing myself helps. But I. Don't. Do. It. And not drinking has lifted some sort of veil. It's easier to say, \"I didn't study because I drank too much\" than, \"I didn't study because I wasted too much time on Reddit.\" Or, \"I didn't fold my laundry because I drank a bottle of wine last night\" instead of, \"I'm lazy.\"\n\nSometimes I think about getting a nice bottle of Pinot and drawing to actually do something productive. Then I'm just drunk and lollygagging on Reddit. I did successfully give up Reddit for 30 days in March, but near the end I was just lollygagging on YouTube videos.\n\nI feel like if I do nothing but Reddit and eat junk this month, I'm not solving anything. I need to re-establish what my life should be. Giving up alcohol for a while is a good first step, and I know my goal tonight is just to go to bed sober, but I can't distract myself with junk food and the internet forever.

We haven\u2019t really spoken since the end of jan - she\u2019s been drunk every time I call but she\u2019s been getting bad back ache and asked me if she could come to stay.  I have a sober policy here and because I suspect her back pain is alcohol related I thought time away from the bottle would maybe get her back on track?  There was a time around Christmas where when I called she would be sober and present 90% of the time,  it was amazing to have my mum back.\n\nI always get anxiety in the lead up to her coming, sometimes she lets me down. The time she was due to stay prior to Christmas she got plastered and somehow knocked her tooth out and woke up on the floor of her home the morning of the flight and of course didn\u2019t set off.  I knew something was up when I couldn\u2019t get through to her on the phone all day yesterday, sure enough when she finally picked up at about 9pm she could barely speak just made noises.  I was stupidly still hopeful she would sleep it off and come then received a call from her at 6am..she still sounded drunk but like someone who\u2019s had a skin full and woken up still drunk..she said she was up to get ready and still coming and would see me in the afternoon (she was getting a lift to airport as she lives abroad).\n\nMy partner went to get her from the airport as planned but she didn\u2019t get off the flight, he called me in a meeting to let me know.  I tried her home phone umpteen times (her mobile was off) I facebook messaged the guy she is seeing that took her there - nothing.  I checked her flight details (my login), it said she checked in..I was then in panic mode.  My partner waited about 40 mins after landing and left.  I text him to ask if he\u2019d look out for her whilst he was driving out in case she was there. Once I was out my meeting 10 mins later I called him and asked if he\u2019d seen her - he blew up at me  \u2018You what? No I\u2019m on my way home\u2019 \n\nI tried the airport who couldn\u2019t tell me anything then manically called her house over and over and over by this time it\u2019s like 3pm her flight got in at 1:45 and I\u2019m so worried - the guy she sees  answered and said she was turned away from the flight.\n\nI feel so hurt and let down but also stupid because what did I expect. My partner is ignoring me upstairs saying I asked him if he saw her with a tone, I tried to call him a few times on my way home to sort it but he ignored my calls.  Since I drank on Friday, although he didn\u2019t see me drunk and I came home at the time I said and slept in the spare room, he\u2019s spoken to me and treated me like absolute shit.  I\u2019m losing my rag - i work so hard, support him constantly with work and home stuff, do all the things around the house (diy garden washing tidying things away make beds etc etc) and I feel like I get fuck all in return.  Where\u2019s my support?  Why is even this about him? The other day whilst saying our relationship was shit cause I don\u2019t do anything for him (!) he threw it in my face that he got us a cleaner like that\u2019s how he supports me but he got a cleaner one day a week because he refused to lift a finger and I was getting so angry at working long hrs all week then spending all weekend each week cleaning the house after us both!The cleaner was the compromise!!\n\nWe are engaged and right now I feel so unsupported I\u2019m really not sure if we should even be together after this week.  I try so hard with sobriety, helping him with his work, cooking, I deal with all the bills and household stuff, I work hard all week , I literally put so much effort into placating him and into making myself a better version constantly and I feel that all he does is knock me down for it and tries to monopolise my time.  He is only happy if I am sat next to him watching tv, if I do anything else I\u2019m being neglectful.  The other day he had a strop because I wouldn\u2019t get his painkillers for him from the room next to ours when we were both in bed - he lay in pain all night to prove a point and I let him because he can\u2019t keep treating me like a second rate citizen and expect me to run around after him.

Please don\u2019t read if it\u2019ll upset or trigger you. \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m 22 and I\u2019ve struggled with multiple mental health issues for maybe 6 years. I started drinking at 18, at first because I was a student and binge drinking is what students do, and then later to deal with all of the horrible thoughts and feelings I was experiencing. Thankfully, I\u2019m not physically dependent on alcohol, but psychological dependence can have an awful effect too. \n\nI spent some time in a psychiatric hospital 6 months ago because I\u2019d tried to kill myself. It was a pathetic attempt really, as an overdose on antidepressants doesn\u2019t do much. I spent the next three months sober. \n\nAnd then on Thursday, I tried again. This time with my dad\u2019s very strong painkillers that contain codeine. I took about 80 of them. I piled them up on my bed and took them by the handful, washing them down with a bottle of wine. I needed CPR, I was rushed to A&amp;E, my stomach was pumped, I was on a drip that tried to reverse the effects for about 20 hours, and essentially could\u2019ve died if my mum hadn\u2019t found me when she did. \n\nI came to in the hospital thoroughly disappointed. \n\nWhy the hell was I still here? I failed again? How embarrassing. \n\nMy boyfriend told me he sat beside me while I was completely out of it and covered in my own vomit and urine, slurring that I was sorry, that I should\u2019ve died, that he\u2019d be so much happier without me, and he sobbed. \n\nThe guilt didn\u2019t hit me straight away. We talked a few days later, once I\u2019d come out of the fog, and he told me that, as much as he wants me to be sober, he could handle me drinking, but dying? What was he going to do if I just stopped existing? How was he supposed to carry on knowing I\u2019d made the decision to end my own life and knowingly leave him behind?\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realised that I didn\u2019t want to die. The alcohol wanted me to die. Any attempt on my life (and there have been a few) had been when I was drunk. Some will say that alcohol just \u201clets your true feelings out\u201d. Fuck that. I truly don\u2019t feel suicidal. Sad, yes. Tired of living, sometimes. But I want to grow old, I want to travel the world, I want to get married, I want to have children, I WANT TO LIVE.  \n\nDrinking so that I can deal with my mental health issues isn\u2019t living. It\u2019s a death sentence. Because if there\u2019s a next time, if I try to kill myself again, maybe I won\u2019t be so lucky to be found. Maybe that\u2019ll just be it. Poof. I\u2019d be gone. And it would be such a waste. \n\nI\u2019ve been back in the psychiatric hospital, but I\u2019m going home today.

Every weekend is more-or-less planned around drinking, Friday we will make a quick dinner (still manage to drink a bottle whilst doing so) &amp; then head out to the local pubs &amp; bars that are only in a short walking distance form us. Saturday he works whilst I do my own thing (walking the dog etc, always sober) - then Saturday night we will almost definitely go out (again) &amp; if not we will cook dinner &amp; share 2 x bottle wine. Sunday's are usually a walk in the hills somewhere then to the pub for a few glasses, dinner &amp; another bottle... Most the time nothing bad happens, however, there are probably 4-5 instances per month where we get blackout drunk, either at home or in one of our local pubs... We have not gone booze-free (together) for more than 2 days over 2 1/2 years. Now, MY health is suffering, both mentally &amp; physically, whereas, he 'seems' to be 'okay' (i.e. no anxiety about being seen drunk in public / miraculously doesn't seem to get hangovers / no ill-health (yet) ) so in his eyes, he sees no point in him quitting. okay, I'm not saying he needs to quit too. When i told him my insides hurt he was incredibly supportive, but said 'go easy this week &amp; see how you feel this w/e' ... I don't know if it sounds stupid &amp; sorry because I know I'm rambling but, I'm nervous about telling him a plan to quit FOREVER. Not nervous because I think he will up &amp; leave or belittle me or anything, absolutely not, but I don't think he fully UNDERSTANDS. He doesn't see any ill-effects of his drinking (yet) so I think he'll think I'm being dramatic. Will our lives be boring without alcohol too? All our holidays revolve around drinking. our weekends. our evenings. our whole lives. \nSorry for the essayyyyy - but, how do you tell your partner you never plan on drinking again?? "}

I've been lurking here for a few weeks and have found the community very inspiring and supportive, so I'll start out with my gratitude. Thank you.\n\nI'm feeling pretty low this morning. I've been stumbling and tripping into sobriety for about 12 months but only managed to get between 3-5 days at a time. Anyway, this time I got 13 days up and then last night I drank a bottle of red wine. I feel so disappointed and depressed about it... I was feeling SO GREAT not drinking! Sleep better, meditation better, energy levels better, mood better... My self-esteem and self-respect were much, much healthier. Not so much today. After finishing my bottle I picked a fight with my husband over nothing and ended up sleeping on the couch. My eldest child (12 yrs) saw. It was the stupidest argument in history, and we've made up now - he doesn't take it personally (extraordinary) - and my life is in order on the outside, I just feel like I'm wired wrong on the inside. I don't know who I become when I drink. I black out and have to ask my husband whether I upset anyone or caused any fights. Disgusting... I'm actually a really lovely, gentle, kind person when I don't drink. I'm high functioning and scared this will be an endless rollercoaster of relapses.\n\nI know I can just start again today. I'm just feeling like I let myself down (and my children) and ruined it. Again.\n\nI guess I'm looking for a boost of optimism and hope. I'm not feeling any self-love or self-respect right now.\n\nThank you for reading. x"}

Over the years I've made similar rules for myself, regarding types of alcohol I drink and times that I drink. \n\nSince then I have stuck to this resolution, but I still drink on the weekends. Usually the second I'm home from work on Friday I crack a beer and usually stay up all night binge drinking by myself. Once I have one beer, I can't stop and usually drink until daybreak or until all of the alcohol is gone. I often drink more than a case of beer or a liter of vodka on these days. \n\nEssentially I have made myself into a functional alcoholic. I don't even have fun or enjoy myself while drinking, I just sit in a depressive fog listening to music. Additionally, the aspect of drinking not interfering with my work hadn't completely worked out because I got wasted at a work conference with an open bar and embarrassed myself in front of colleagues that I really respect. \n\nI'm really trying to quit drinking all together because I realized that it is bad for my health both mentally and physically. Considering the amount I drink, it also consumes my weekend. I feel like garbage during the week due to lack of sleep and most likely the heavy calories from binge drinking and then binge eating when hungover. Usually on Wednesday or Thursday I start to feel good again before I get wasted on Friday.\n\nThis has become such a routine for me, that it is really difficult to break. On Fridays now, if I don't drink, I feel very agitated and bored. I find if I can make it through Friday night, I will wake up Saturday and go run errands and find things to do. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation? \n\nI like to play video games and I want to start working out, but honestly I'm unsure what else to do in my free time.\n\nI am not interested in AA, I have gone to meetings in the past and didn't like it or find it helpful for me personally. \n"}

I had just finished working Mother's Day in my restaurant and it was just balls out all day.  Even though I'm currently on probation, my alcoholic mind talked me into stopping at the liquor store on my way home.  I bought a pint of vodka and got home and got started.  I don't meet up with my PO until June 11th so I don't currently have to take the piss tests.  This was my justification for drinking... \"I still have time to get away with it\"\n\nLong story short, I spent most of my drunk hours writing letters to people that I will never send.  It was a visceral experience.  This morning I woke up and feel ashamed knowing that I was out of control.  I fully intend on attending my first AA meeting tonight as I literally have no one in my life that is supportive of a sober life.  All my friends know I am on probation for my 2nd DUI but STILL invite me every night for after shift drinks.

{"author": "destructiveinfluence", "creation_date": "2018-05-30 20:07:59", "selftext": "Hey sobernauts.\n\nI posted here about a week back, just after finishing my last binge. I want to start off by humbly offering my thanks to everyone who reached out. This sub has been amazing, and I look forward to visiting every day. Anyways, here are some of my reflections this wonderful, sober period.\n\nThe first time I quit was back in August 2017. I was presented with an ultimatum by my girlfriend: either I stop drinking, or she leaves. Pretty straightforward, right? And it was, for about seven or eight months, albeit with white\\-knuckled grit. I started it out with an AA\\-meeting, but then never returned for a second \\(red flag, anyone?\\). It wasn't that I didn't enjoy it, but I figured I didn't need any help. If I decided to do this, then I would do it. No AA, no SD, no rehab, no shrink, no support whatsoever. Then after a while, something magical \\(i.e. defying all logic or reason\\) happened.\n\nI suddenly thought, 'Well shit... I'm not an alcoholic, am I? I can control myself *now,* right?', and for some reason and in spite of all empirical evidence pointing the other way, I imbibed that lie. Then, the worst possible thing occurred the first time I had a drink again... I actually **didn't** get blackout drunk. That confirmed the illusion; I was *back,* baby! I rationalized that it had only been my depression\\-period that had caused me to drink. It had been because I was in disarray, and because I had been anxious and in bad shape. I saw that all these aspects of my life were improving now, so I could obviously drink again! I never stopped to think, thoroughly, about *why* life was improving... but deep down, I did know. Somewhere, submerged in endless layers of ego, arrogance, self\\-deceit and selfishness, I did hear that muffled voice.\n\nAnd I disregarded it completely.\n\nAs you can imagine, it went downhill from there. Now, my girlfriend might leave me after my terrible binge at a bachelor's party in Poland... and I wouldn't blame her for a second. Again I had it proven to me that when I drink, I erode the building blocks of my life. Inevitably, pieces of this structure must crumble and collapse under the pressure. Inevitably, I must lose part of who I am sober to accommodate who I am drunk.\n\nI was, in other words, bitch\\-smacked by reality. I was hungover for almost a weak, and in an emotional and spiritual crisis. There was this terrible dissonance between who I wanted to be, and who the demon of alcohol turned me into when I drank. Gradually but undeniably, drunk\\-me has become more brazen, more aggressive, more manipulative and, in general, more of a contemptible sonofabitch. It's a well\\-documented and familiar pattern for many alcoholics I've spoken to; like drunk you gets more comfortable in your skin... like everything becomes more and more about *him* \\(or her\\). It almost seemed like this alter ego was doing everything in his power to destroy my life, and destroy all the things I had worked so hard for... and I was letting him. But I refused to let that happen, and resolved, through tears of anguish and remorse, to quit. Again.\n\nThen I ran, or rather fled, to the first AA\\-meeting I could attend. Then I went to another one the next day... and then the day after that. This time around, it felt like I was coming home... like I had found a bastion of strength. Some of the members remembered me from last time and smiled, 'It's always so wonderful when people come back.' That was it. No judgement, no shame, no condemnation. Just genuine relief that the prodigal son \\(and sadly, there are many of us\\) had returned. And I finally realized... I'm actually powerless. I have *actually* lost control of my life. I can never hit harder than my alcoholism, and so I have to hit better. I need to be tactical. I need to surround myself with people and resources that can remind me what terrible course I would be set upon if I had that first drink. Something clicked in me, like my life flashed before my eyes. I resonated with every story, every shared regret, every signal of hope. I'm only 24, and I've never  broken the law or been in jail \\(which is just pure luck\\)... but I've done some things that the shame of which nearly ate me alive. The pain and regret that permeated these stories is what struck a familiar cord with me, and so I could relate. It almost didn't matter what they'd done, because I knew that if I continued to drink, I would always stoop to a new low. And then I realized something else...\n\nThe person I am when sober has ambitions and desires. I want to be a good man, I want to be a father, I want to be a person people can trust and be safe around. But I am also terribly insecure, self\\-loathing, hard on myself, constantly full of shame and extremely anxious. This, coupled with a huge pride, arrogance and bloated ego make for an ungodly synergy I call 'fuck\\-you\\-and\\-your\\-self\\-insight'ness. It has caused me a lot of trouble, and I think it has driven me back to alcohol many times and hindered me in seeing the truth of my alcoholism. And, as if on some terrible vendetta, drunk me has always tried to vehemently *prove* to me how terrible I am. I do things when drunk I know I wouldn't even enjoy sober, and if there was an inkling of a chance that I might \\(on some base level\\), then it would still be in conflict with who I want to be and thus, not be worth it.\n\n\"See? You manipulated that girl to sleep with you. You don't care about love, you're just a superficial dick.\"\n\n\"Remember all those nasty things you said last night?\"\n\n\"Hey, that bus ride. You were a cocky asshole who made everyone's life miserable.\"\n\n\"Can you believe you spent all that money on a strip club? Lol, you're an asshole. Now go drink.\"\n\nIt becomes this self\\-fulfilling prophecy, and I fell for it time and time again. My alcoholism dripped into every aspect of my person. The demon came out when I drank, sure, but I didn't consider how it left a sucking chest wound in me even after the hangover had passed. This self\\-doubt... this terrible \"knowledge\" that in reality, no matter how well I do at work or what people say to me, I'm a monster undeserving of any praise or love or, least of all, forgiveness. It wasn't even directly related to my drinking \\- it was just a general notion that I was a fucked up human being that didn't deserve *any* of the good things in life. And life... well, that was slowly being sucked out of me, and I couldn't even see it for the lie it was.\n\nPaul Hedderman \\(thanks to u/sovietcableguy for sharing this gem with me\\) compares alcoholism to a parasite. It can't drink on its own accord, so it relies on the host \\(me\\) to drink for it, so that it can live *through* me. The best way for it to ensure its survival is to convince the host that it itself is the host. But I realize now that the things I've done while drunk... it's not me. It's some malformed, simple, perverted shade of me, but it isn't me. I don't want to let that demon hijack my life anymore. I'm not willing to let him sit at the wheel anymore. But finally, I realize, that I can't do that alone. If I fight alone, all this energy will eventually be co\\-opted and turned on me, and I will drink again. As one of the AA\\-members at a meeting I attended said, 'Nobody around this table lacks willpower. In fact, you probably have more than most... that's not what makes us drink.'\n\nI am powerless. And that's okay. Understanding that has been the most liberating thing I have ever experienced... and becoming free from the demon; reclaiming the ship, is now my foremost objective. If I don't, I will lose everything \\- my life included. I don't intend to perish like *that*.\n\nIt's time to get better, and to be honest about it. I'm ready.\n\nHope you guys have an amazing day, and for all our sakes, IWNDWYT.\n\nP.S: Sorry for the absolute wall of text \\- I had a lot on my mind.\n\nEDIT: Formatting"}

Eventually that would lead to me not taking them anymore at all because of so many days straight of drinking.

I had a shitty week with family stuff, work stuff and PMS - nothing major, however. My boyfriend was out of town and I went out with my best friend on Friday night. \n\nMade a huge mistake sitting at the restaurant bar. Even though there were no tables available and the bar was the only option, suffice to say I would have rather left and gotten Taco Bell than reset my badge if I were doing it again. \n\nI wasn't planning on drinking at all that day (or ever again) but the woman next to me ordered a glass of wine and when I saw it, my brain was just like \"WANT\". A few seconds later the bartender asked me what I wanted, I ordered a glass of pinot, my best friend was like \"Uh, are you SURE?\" I said yes, and in less than 30 seconds I went from 260 days to 0 days. It tasted like shit the first 2 sips, then the rest of it was pretty fucking good, but I nursed it because it was a generous pour and I had a head buzz immediately. \n\nAnd...that's it. We had dinner and then she came over and we just drank La Croix and talked. I developed a horrible headache at midnight, then had a shitty, sweaty, heart racing, super anxious, dry mouth night's sleep and I was legit hungover the next day. No DUI, no binge, no fights, no puking, no drunken texts, no flirting, nothing \"bad\", but it sure as shit was not worth it. \n\nThe worst part is that my boyfriend and I quit together and now he's at 263 and I'm back at 3. I honestly thought he would be the one to relapse (no shade, I was just feeling like this was easier for me) and he was shocked, upset and disappointed when I told him the next day, so much that he expressed concern at the future of our relationship. From the outside this would seem like no big deal but I get it; sobriety is hard and I might have a similar reaction if the shoe was on the other foot. We started this journey together but our paths diverged because of this...maybe it'll be better for both of us this way, maybe not, but this has been the hardest thing for me to stomach. \n\nI'm still thinking about the road that led me there and I think there are some takeaways with the time of day (Friday afternoons can still be a trigger), family/mom stuff and all week I'd had a strong \"bottled up\" feeling all week like I had a lot to say but no one to say it to and it was just sitting in my chest like a big black ball.\n\nThere are quite a few badge reset posts on here that involve benders and real-deal consequences but I just wanted to post this for my own accountability and also to share that even a \"no big deal\" relapse is still a relapse. I considered breezing past this, not resetting my badge and not telling my boyfriend or anyone else IRL but my decision to drink came up on me so fast and hard, it felt like I got jumped. I don't feel like a total failure or anything but I just wish I hadn't made that choice and hope I can learn something from this. \n\nIWNDWYT"}

This morning I woke up at 9am - almost unheard of for me on a Sunday without an alarm to make it so. \n\nI'm loving the energy levels I've got, my even mood, the extra time in the day, the fact that I'm eating far less junk than I would when drunk/hungover.\n\nWhenever I stop drinking, this happens - I really don't know why I struggle so much to maintain once I hit a month or so, I MUCH prefer sober me, and sober me is far closer to the best version of me that I can make. \n\nI'm not sure whether I will stay fully sober - I would like to think I can change it up so that I can drink at my best school mate's 40th and best uni mate's 40th (and my own for that matter!) later this summer, and not fall back into my terrible habits away from big occasions. Maybe it's the case that I have to give up drink completely, I tend to struggle with shades of grey on this - I seem to have a very \"all-or-nothing\" relationship with drinking in general, and the amount I drink when I do drink.\n\nI'm incredibly glad to have managed to step away from the whirlwind nightlife working can be and have this clarity - for anyone else in a similar boat, it can be done. I've generally been good at Sober Octobers and Dry Januarys, but this is my first sober period since 40 days last summer. It's amazing (and a little bit scary tbh) how different the world looks after even just 11 days without drinking.\n\nPS - I've been helped this last week or two by using a couple of things, the apps 5 Minute Journal and WinStreak, and by keeping a journal morning and night (the latter I've been doing on and off for months, but really knuckled down since quitting 11 days back). Really handy to consciously promise to stay sober daily, and then celebrate it at the end of the day on WinStreak\n\nPPS - sorry for the gigantic wall of text\n\nTL;DR - it ain't easy staying sober when people are constantly trying to give you free shots and drinks at your workplace, but so far so good, and it is 100% worth it"}

The other is the ease with which I shrug and reply \"I don't drink\" when offered alcohol.\n\n*One day at a time* took a long time to sink in, but once it did, not drinking became easier. The other tip from this sub that carries me through rough times is HALT--hungry, angry, lonely, tired. The rare fleeting thought of alcohol usually comes at times when I'm overly tired and overly stressed. What I want is immediate escape from both of these things, not alcohol. Being able to identify why I'm thinking about alcohol allows me to deal with the real issue rather than ignoring it for a few hours. I've never woken up the next day and regretted not drinking. So cliche, so true.\n\nThe other bit of wisdom from this sub that has made a difference in ways well beyond dealing with alcohol is \"speaking from the I\". I know my personal and professional relationships are better because I'm more mindful of speaking from my experience. I've made these observations here before, but I think it's worth stating that these things are still true.

When i was in hs i smoked a lot of weed and drank a lot. Right after I graduated I got sober. Didnt drink from 18-22. Then a year and a half ago I picked up the bottle one day after work and just didnt put it back down. Few weeks after that my husband told me he had gotten another woman pregnant and we split. Couple months later I got arrested for a domestic because he wouldnt let me take my child. No custody agreement meant he then was able to keep our child from me for 3 months until I got custody in court. Spent those 3 months trying to drink myself to death. Cheap vodka all day every day. Got sober for about a month after getting my child back. Then custody changed again so i had a lot less time with him. Got arrested for violating the no contact order a few times. Knew how much I messed up so I again went on a binge for months drinking all day every day. Spent about another month sober and relapsed at the end of March. Got my first DUI and almost killed myself.  Felt dumb and hopeless so ever since then I've just been drinking the pain away. But I can't do this anymore. It's so much work to hide the drinking. To pretend to be someone I'm not. To act like I have it all together. I want to ACTUALLY have it all together. I miss the sober me. But I know I cant do it alone. I know I need help. And I'm getting it. Last night was my final straw. Went to a concert and got almost black out drunk. This concert was on a riverfront and I ended up climbing the fence and standing on this ledge that was a straight like 100 foot drop into choppy waters and proba ly large rocks. And I was so drunk I almost fell. Luckily someone saw me and dragged me back over the fence. I don't want to die. So I will not drink today. \n"}

That is, **withdrawal from alcohol had positive, rebound\\-like effects on neurogenesis**.

I felt like there was something wrong with being there but didn't know what.  When asked what I wanted to drink, I actually drew a blank.  I couldn't think of anything.  Then it came back to me.  \"Bulliet Bourbon, neat\" .  I then pictured the drink and said \"wait, make that a double\".   Picturing the small glass of bourbon made me panic that it wasn't enough.  Literally, I felt panic in my dream.  I am conditioned from looking at the bottle after I poured a drink making sure I had enough to last the night.\n\nFinally, I woke up one morning and said \"Phil, you are 100&amp;#37; functional.

A 750mL bottle, at that.  Not even close my typical 1.5L bottle per night that I was dosing up until I was taken to the hospital by the police.  Then, late last week, my new psychiatrist took me off of one med I was taking at a super high dose and put me on a low dose of Seroquel (because, as she and I both know, starting at a therapeutic dose of Seroquel from the get-go means sleeping 18-20+ hours a day for months).  Two days after that change, my panic attacks came back and are worse than they've been in a couple of years.  I'm throwing up from them again, afraid to leave my apartment, afraid to leave my bed...  I'm even having them in my sleep again.\n\nToday I ended up buying a bottle of wine that is usually $12-15 per 1.5L bottle but was on sale for $6.99.  I couldn't resist when I saw the sale.  I intentionally got a low-alcohol containing variety because my tolerance is lower and I don't want to do something exponentially more stupid.\n\nI'm not drunk now.  I just got back from the store and poured myself a glass, but I've been staring at it the whole time after taking a sip.  I'm disappointing myself, my fiance, and my family, and they don't even know it yet.  This is the best sobriety streak I've had in years...\n\nYou all know the struggle.  Talk some sense into me.  I know the panic attacks will subside in a few days (the med change coincided with my period--two of the strongest triggers at once), I've lost 40lbs and don't need to drink empty calories...  But I'm so afraid to go out right now, and with my med changes, I'm on *nothing* for anxiety for the first time in almost ten years.  I've only had two therapy sessions.  I don't know how to cope.\n\nThanks...  &lt;3\n\nA Noteworthy Edit:\n\nI was put on Naltrexone at the first hospital I was at during my two-month inpatient stays.  It definitely helped with the cravings.  They said it would make it difficult for me to feel the alcohol's intoxication as well, although, since I was in the hospital, I never experienced that.  Should I ask for that again?  My therapist works at the same place as my psychiatrist and I have an appointment there on Friday morning."}

I opened up to her about my problem and she explained the tools she used, her approach to sobriety, and really made the idea of actually getting sober seem doable. In a way, she kinda sketched out a crude map. She gave me a token that she used whenever she needed a reminder, and for her to give that to me really meant a lot.

More and more I'm seeing that drinking is a problem and is affecting my life negatively. I grew up in AA. Literally, I remember being 5 years old and listening to the meeting while I colored. It felt like home. I loved the smell of coffee and cigarettes, and listening to deep conversations. I felt safe there, but never did I think I would end up in their seats. My mom and step father were and still are extremely active in the group. The thought of ME ever sitting in a meeting for myself? Yeah, that's humorous \\- but I'm seeing now that I probably need it.\n\nI began drinking socially every Friday night out with friends about a year and a half ago. Before then I could go out to bars and clubs, and have no desire to drink. I didn't understand the appeal until my first drunken night and it was over from there. I was at the time \\(now engaged and living with my fianc\u00e9\\) a single mom who needed the outlet. But I began going out more, leaving my son with babysitters. The time out got longer and how drunk I was got worse. I remember experiencing my first hangover and saying I'll never do that again. That was a lie. I was drinking to get over my narcissistic ex whom I was deeply in love with and hurt by.\n\nFast\\-foward to when I met my fianc\u00e9 a little over a year ago. I was the party girl, but I hated that because I never was that way before. When I met him, suddenly CRAZY behavior started coming out. I would go insane sometimes, fighting with him. I was always the fun drunk but something about him made me lose a screw. One night I became drunkenly suicidal after what was supposed to be a fun night out with him and friends. I've had several of those, all with him. I feel so bad for what I've put him through... Honestly, I was horrible. Because of that, we quit \"going out\" and binging. Now we take it easy more at home. When we have gone out, I prove to him I won't binge drink. It's manipulation so that he will think I'm fine and without a problem when I drink at home. I think, \"ok, don't get sloppy drunk. Get a little buzz, but no hangover the next morning... that way you can drink regularly at home. You need that more than a party one night\". Crazy! Just this past weekend we went out with friends and I watched a few of my friends get shit\\-faced. I told my fianc\u00e9, \"aren't you happy I'm not drinking like that anymore?\" It's disgusting, but I did that to get the \"free pass\" to drink more. If I'm not out of control \\(seemingly\\) then he won't be mad at me for drinking. I've even began to hide it, though. :\\(\n\nYet, my drinking at night never stopped. I now have a glass or two of wine, but pour extra when he's not looking. I've even moved on to hard liquor. I'm getting skilled at pretending I'm not drunk, but I am almost every single night. Last night he wasn't home \\- he hasn't been home for a week due to a business trip. I drank EVERY NIGHT, alone. Last night I got hammered. I drank a whole bottle of wine \\(I'm petite\\) and made a huge mistake that will likely ruin my relationship. I woke up the next morning and told myself I'm going to quit. I considered a meeting, but wouldn't want my fianc\u00e9 to know I was going, so I didn't go. I don't want to admit I have a problem. If I admit that, then I have to really quit. Does that make sense? Like I would normally be having my first drink of the night \\(9pm\\) after my son is asleep... but I'm TRYING to resist. I honestly might drink tonight.... but at least I'm admitting this. I'm afraid of quitting because I equate drinking with fun. How will I ever have fun or mask any of my emotional pain again? UGH.

{"author": "cerrunos87", "creation_date": "2018-05-03 20:38:33", "selftext": "I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  This is my first time putting this into writing, so I may ramble a bit.\n\nI'm 30 years old, and have been drinking, regularly or semi-regularly for 15 years, though my first real experience with alcohol happened when I was 10 at my dad's 30th birthday party.  I had finished a soda, and kept refilling the can with beer and wine coolers from the cooler.\n\n6 years later I'm working at a Boy Scout camp in Germany, walking down to the Village after the duty day was complete, spending my meager pay at the local bar with my friends.  After returning home I had a few more instances of heavy drinking in high school.\n\nThen I went to college.  My first night there I went out with my neighbors from the dorm, found a party and drank the night away.  My first semester I was good about keeping my partying to the weekends.  My second semester I was a full member of a fraternity, and had moved out of the dorms and into the house. I started drinking more frequently, using Trivia Night or Logo Glass Night as an excuse to go to the bar any night of the week.  Even if I didn't go out, I'd stay in and find someone to play beer pong, or some other drinking game with.  I stopped going to classes, and withdrew from all my classes halfway through the semester.  That summer I joined the Army, but had to wait a year to ship out.  I enrolled in classes for the fall semester, but fell into my old habits and started drinking and partying heavily, and stopped going to class.  I didn't even bother registering for classes during the spring semester of that year, and just hung out at the fraternity house or the campus bars drinking away student loan money, and donating plasma so I could drink some more.  I should have recognized then that my relationship with alcohol was destructive, but I had a million and one other reasons for my failure.\n\nShipped off to Basic Training that summer.  Had a wonderful (no, really!) experience there.  Had family day on my 21st birthday, but wasn't allowed to drink.  A few weeks later, during AIT (military occupation training) we \"phased\" up and were allowed off post during the day on weekends.  Every Friday and Saturday night were spent off post consuming copious amounts of beer and liquor. In spite of that I was able to graduate that training with honors.\n\nAfter graduation, I go back home (I chose reserve component so I could continue going to school).  I re-enroll in the same college for the fall semester.  This should have been my Junior year, but I didn't even have enough credits to be counted as a Sophomore.  You'd think with my recent return from an environment with rigid discipline I'd be focused and determined to get back on track.  And I was. For a while. But then I let my drinking get the better of me again, and having fun became more important than achieving my goals.  I finally gave up any pretense of going to school the following semester and returned home to live with my parents.  I drank as much and as often as I could afford with my lack of expenses and small monthly check from drilling with the Army.\n\nThe following year, I deployed.  No alcohol for almost a year, barring my R&amp;R halfway through, and I didn't mind it.  I was doing my job, and feeling more alive than I ever had.  I returned home at the end of my deployment, having bought a fast car and having several thousand dollars in the bank.  I started going out with friends regularly, drinking insane amounts, and with my new found sense of immortality often getting behind the wheel at the end of the night.  \n\nThis came to a head one night when high-speed, way to much to drink, and a batch of black ice caused me to careen into a brick wall.  Whats worse, my best friend was in the passenger seat as I was taking him back to his car. I managed to avoid any injury more serious than some superficial cuts and some bruising of my shoulder and kidney from the seatbelt.  My friend suffered more severe injuries when his head struck the brick wall.  Luckily he was able to make a full recovery over the next few weeks. I stopped drinking for over a year during all the legal proceedings and until my license suspension was up.\n\nOnce I started drinking again, I did pretty well at managing it.  I only drank occasionally, and often as little as a single beer with my meal.  Rarely did I drink enough to get drunk. I was introduced to my two year old son from a previous relationship and was really starting to bond with him. I met the woman that would become my wife that summer.  Things were going great!\n\nThen my mom died, suddenly and unexpectedly.  I turned to alcohol to feel numb and get through the following weeks. I lost my job several months later, and found a new one in commission based sales almost immediately.  Almost every night, on my way home, I'd stop and buy a case of beer which would be gone by the next morning.  I'd go to work hung over most days, and sometimes we'd drink on the job.  That company went out of business shortly after, and I had to find yet another job.  I stayed in the same field, though, and eventually wound up as a store manager.  That job stressed me to no end, on top of realizing that I was carrying around some scars from my deployment.  Instead of buying beer on my way home, I was buying a bottle of whiskey on my way in and mixing it with fountain soda all day long.  I was spiraling out of control, and drunkenly quit that job one day just a few hours into my shift.\n\nI got a new job in yet another field.  This one gave me three days off during the week, which I more often than not, spent pounding beers.  Twice I passed out and was woken up by a call from my son's school because I was late to pick him up.  One of those times I also missed a parent/child event that I told him I was going to attend.\n\nI would often get into angry arguments with my wife while drunk.  Vehemently denying that I had had anything to drink.  I would have buried the bottles in the bottom of the outside trashcan before she got home.  Just as I had done a week ago today.  She caught me in the lie.  The very next day I got home and cracked a beer, planning on just having one or two to unwind after work.  I don't remember the rest of the evening. I woke up in the morning and as I was getting out of bed to take the dog out my wife mumbled that she was still mad at me.  At this point, I was scared shitless that I had done something irredeemable.\n\nI hadn't.  When she woke up a while later, we talked.  I told her, \"I'm sorry you married an alcoholic\", and we made a plan. I didn't drink at all that day, in spite of being at a joint party for my father and son.  I haven't drank since. We are going together to an open AA meeting tonight."}

I\u2019m a 23 year old college student and I loved to drink... I could not accept that I was an alcoholic since I just belittled the situations and pretended I was just a party girl in my head. There were so many red flags looking back on it that should have made me realize. The constant need to worry about if there would be enough to drink for me including drinking half empty beers on pool tables at frat parties to going home with whatever guy had booze that I knew...I never thought I would quit but I realize now how alcohol clouded my judgement and I wanted it to be my only friend. Alcohol came before anything else in my life and I pushed away those that I loved when I was drunk. Tomorrow I have 50 days sober and I feel absolutely amazing. Of course I miss having the crazy nights to \u201c look forward to\u201d but when I consider it they weren\u2019t ever actually fun since I\u2019d wake up with regret every time hating myself. The thought that they were fun is just alcohol trying to get its way back into my life but not again! \n\nAA has been a saving grace for me and getting myself to that first meeting was the hardest part. It is all about meeting shopping and finding the groups you click with. I thank God my first group just happened to be a group of all young and middle aged women because I heard my story there. That\u2019s the amazing thing about alcoholics we all connect on the reason for drinking to fill an empty void in our hearts and an uncomfortable feeling in the world we can\u2019t quite place. Instead of dealing with my emotions I drank. I am proud to say I have not woken up regretting anything for the past 49 days my life has just begun.\nIWNDWYT"}

It uses the same twelve steps, but the focus there is of taking care of yourself, learning how to set boundaries, and not accepting the blame the alcoholic often wants to heap on you.   \n \n\nFor some reason I don't quite understand at their yearly anniversary meetings they invite an AA speaker in.  I've done this a few times over the years, and it's tricky. This is not the place to tell war stories, to 'qualify'. Instead, as I see it \u2013 it's a place for sharing my experience, strength, and hope \u2013 and last night, the commonalities many of us share. \n\n  \n  I spoke of powerlessness \u2013 that at one point I was incapable of keeping the promises I made to myself that I would not drink that day.  Or the promise that I would 'take it easy'.  I drank. I got drunk.   No matter how sincere I had been.  I spoke of having elastic lines \u2013 so I did not have to cross them.   I mentioned advanced degrees in rationalization.  \n  \n\nThen I switched to the real powerlessness \u2013 over everything else.  People in particular, wife, kids, boss, the guy who is trying to merge, the customer with an attitude.  I could not change them.  Sure I can ram my fender into the guy who is trying to get in front of me, but that's a lesson learned pretty quickly as we both watch traffic pass and argue on the side of the road..   \n \n\n A quick note: This was not totally foreign to me. I have enough alcoholism in my family to 'qualify' for Alanon \\(many of us do\\) and have attended these meetings on and off over the years.  There is a great deal I have learned from them. In particular: **That I can start my day over at any time.  That somebody's opinion of me is none of my business. That renting space in my head to someone does neither of us any good.**     \n \n\n I kept it short, I kept it upbeat \\(and they did not laugh nearly as easily as an AA room would have\\).  My main point was that the only thing I can change in any situation is my attitude.  Then, after about ten minutes I ended.   \n  \n\nI was followed by two Alanon speakers \u2013 and was reminded of just how much damage we can do with our drinking/drugging.  They spoke of 'waiting for THE phone call' they described the heartbreak of watching children destroy their own lives \u2013 and the emotional wreckage spreading to parents and beyond.  They spoke of love being chipped at and eroded by anger \u2013 and having to let go and watch the child they love follow a dangerous dark path.  None of the speakers last night described having to at the age of 60 step in and raise grandchildren that were being neglected or worse by addict parents \u2013 but there were a couple of them in the room... And they spoke of how the program had helped them come to grips with the problem, that they were no longer so alone.  \n  \n\nEarly on in my speaking I said that as a part of the problem \u201cmy middle name is DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO\u201d  That resonated,  These people knew that one.   \n  \n\nIn many ways I said, **recovery is learning how to become teachable. Simply learning how to listen.**  \n    \n  "}
{"author": "Alectrona_", "creation_date": "2018-05-25 22:30:28", "selftext": "Hi. Ive been to 3 AA meetings. A little about me:\nI binge drank as a teenager with my friends every weekend or so. I had a larger problem around age 18 and spent about 1.5 months drinking every second day. I decided I didnt like that and quit drinking for about 6 months. I gradually started drinking again, found myself in an emotionally abusive relationship, and was not drinking frequently, but each time I drank it was binge drinking to cover up anxiety and dread. As I got a bit older and got out of that bad relationship, I noticed that if I was in a certain 'down' mood or anxious, I was more likely to drink, so I was using alcohol to calm the anxiety (which it never did no matter how much I drank) or to keep myself in a mental down mood 'rut' because drinking was literally easier than doing anything else even though other stuff would have changed my mood (exercise! creating anything!). So I drank fairly infrequently for the past 3-4 years, but in the past year I've noticed that about 60% of the time when I have a drink I dont know if I'm just having 1 drink or more, it feels like it's not up to me in a way? So much mental energy has been used on Friday nights going back and forth between \"Am i just having one drink? But what if i want more? What if i drink too much? \nthen what if i do/say something bad? Should I even go? What if I feel anxious? Can i leave? Is it rude? Should i have another drink to not be rude?\" etc etc. I dont usually like to go out, maybe once every 3 months, but this is a conversation I have with myself. But sometimes I'm very confident that I can have just one beer, and have done so on many occasions, because i enjoy the taste of craft beer and dont actually like the feeling of being tipsy or drunk. Anyway, it's been confusing to not fit into the \"mold\" of an alcoholic, but I figured if I can't always tell if 1 drink is going to be 1 drink, and if I can't guarantee control over my drunk self, then it's better to stop than to hurt myself and/or others.\n\nBack to meetings:\nI picked a group that has a younger crowd so I'd feel more comfortable. I really like a lot about the meetings, but some stuff puts me off because of personal reasons, or has me feelings 'left out'. \n\nI like that the group is really good as in positive, funny, genuine, humbling. Its on a weekend morning, so it almost feels like church in a way? Like a place to discuss a larger picture, and I think this is mostly what I like about it. There is lots of laughter and honestly and vulnerability, and those things feel nourishing.\n\nI'm definitely put off by repetitive parts of it(reminds me of cult-y parts of church), addressing everyone with \"Hi (first name)\" and \"thanks (first name)\" when someone wants to share.\n\n I also don't care much about the chips? And the milestones? I view each day sober as wonderful and I dont care about the number, if its day 5 or 5 years. To be a \"member\" of the group I have to give them the day of the last drink I had? But this number doesnt feel important to me, I'm not shy about it, I don't feel shame about it, I just feel neutral. I can see why for most alcoholics its a HUGE thing though. \n\nThe 12 steps:\nI dont have interest in doing the 12 steps at this point, or ever, not that anyone has asked me to, and I know my opinion can change. They are talked about a lot, and I've read over them but there is definitely something missing when most of the people in the group have worked through them at least once, so people reference them and their experience a lot. I feel a little lost listening to these experiences, but can relate to some of them.\n\nIm also really not down with describing my lack of self control as disease. But I feel like this has been talked about a lot in the subreddits.\n\nEven though there are a lot of negatives or questions in this list, I'd say that I enjoy or find useful 70-80% of the meetings. I just don't feel like I have problems in some of the same ways people are talking about having problems and it doesn't make me feel 'fucked up enough' to be there, and that coupled with not interested in the chips or ever doing the 12 steps makes me feel weird when people wanna connect with me and have me come back. I feel like I have to sign up for it all for some reason."}

Not really expecting it to be any different than the other times I said I would quit. Usually I would not smoke all day but by the time night came around I would crack and smoke.

I have been drinking socially from my late twenthies (I am 39 now), reaching the peak 1-2 years ago, when I became one bottle of wine per night daily drinker (to relief the stress issues at work) till 26th March of this year. That thay at morning I woke up with a shaky hands and that was a sign something should be changed. I called emergency, passed through detox, started slowly to change a life style (eating healthier, gym, gathering with friends, etc.), going to alcohol ambulance check ups, started with psichological therapy (CBT),  and managed to stay without alcohol for allmost 2 months (59 days precisely). I am really determined to leave this poison once for good. I have managed to lose a lot of weight too (14 kg), in general feeling much, much better, performing good at work, sleeping like a baby, way better than before. Nevertheless, last 4-5 days I felt a bit depressed (most probably due to the weather changes), bit nervous and thinking about how I was such a stupid to let myself to get into this situation. Most probably you have asked yourself the same question. I am wondering, would this periods od bad mood go with a time? Regarding to the cravings, I do not have them, I have no wish to drink (probably because of Revia which I take every morning). I supose this is the brain chemistry that plays with me these days. I would like to ask some of you experienced guys who are sober for a longer time how did you cope with this? Just taking it one day at the time? Occupying yourself with other things, etc? Also, I live alone, weekends can be long somethimes if the are not planned well. Just to mention, I haven't been on AA meetings (there is no other alternative to them in the place where I live), please write about your experience about them. Does it make a sense to attend it? \n\nSincerely, for this day more, your sobber friend Vladimir"}

I have to be done with this drinking bullshit.  \n\nIt\u2019s killing me.  \n\nI\u2019ve posted here before, under a different account, during the last THREE vacations I\u2019ve taken.  I go crazy drinking on vacation and it eventually catches up and I spend a whole day or two feeling like absolute hell.  \n\nThat day is today.  I\u2019m in a tropical paradise and am hunkered down in the A/C because my body decided it had enough abuse.  I\u2019ve done this during the last 3 vacations and keep swearing to myself that I would have a sober vacation for once and enjoy getting up early for yoga or walking the beach.  Didn\u2019t make it once and we leave tomorrow.

I feel like such a dope that I\u2019ve been in a tropical paradise and wasted it yet again.  \n\nLast night was a tipping point.  I was trying so hard to get drunk that my body was retching, trying to avoid another onslaught of poison.

I hate my work life but I am so specialized in what I do that I cannot easily change jobs without relocating my family.  So I drink every day to pass the time.  I just drink harder on vacation because I am trying to blot out the reality that I cannot stand my job, I feel trapped, and have to return to the shithole once I get home.  I woke up every morning with a sense of dread and just started day drinking to mask it.  \n\nSorry for the downer post but the upshot is that I\u2019m so sick of this bullshit that I\u2019m finally ready to stop drinking.  Unlike the last 3 \u201cI\u2019m done!\u201d Vacation posts, I absolutely have to mean it this time.

I've been a part of a group that fights for open space and maintains a large urban/wild park for years, and everyone but me is a big drinker. \n\nWe have work days of building/maintaining trails and they all end in (guess what?) drinking. One drink's on us!\nThere are quite a few of these groups in the city and each has their own park that they support. They all gather and drink in a \"super group\" once in a while.\n\nI feel left out and like I don't belong anymore because I don't drink. What really gets me is how one of them bragged last night about how places like REI and other outdoorsy co's used to fund us, now we're ENTIRELY funded by local breweries. He was elated and proud of this. They also very much promote alcohol on our site and newsletter now: \"Come drink with us at_______ and we'll get $1 per beer sold.....\"\n\nI guess this is more of a rant than advice seeking, but I'm frankly sick to death of this \"marriage\" between being an active person and alcohol consumption. And it's not just these parks groups...it's climbing, mtb, hiking....ALL of them seem to center on alcohol at the end of the day. A lot of the beer companies really push on the \"outdoorsy person mystique\" or whatever the fuck it is.\n\nNow, I realize that not everyone drinks, but I enjoy being in groups like this and don't want something like AA to be my social outlet, or the group I identify with. I've known these guys for years and this was not how it was at the beginning at all.\n\nI'll stick with it, I guess, but I definitely feel treated differently now that I don't go out and get shit-faced with them anymore. I also feel like it's damaging for kids to see this unholy coupling.\n\nAnd what really gets me is that I'm so on board with the whole locally owned craft type scene, but I wish it wasn't based on beer. I can't even believe how many breweries there are now. Maybe part of it is jealousy or longing, but I know I can't ever go back to that world or I'm screwed. It just makes me sad. \n\nHonestly, I have SO much more fun doing outside stuff now that I'm not hungover and depressed. I guess I feel helpless because they're set in their ways and it's how it's going to be from now on with them. I have to just let it go I guess. My lone voice of not wanting our group to be alcohol-identified is like a spit in the ocean. They wouldn't understand my point of view at all."}

Shaking, hot-cold flashes and utter doom. I was so close to calling myself an ambulance but chose not to. I was on a crazy bender for 3 days due to a breakup.\n\nSo now I have been sober for 6 days, I refuse to ever go on a crazy bender again but now its  memorial day weekend and I want to have some drinks with my friends 6-12 drinks. I wont be drinking how i was during my bender 25+ drinks a night. Can I have 6-12 beers without going thru full blown withdrawal since i will be drinking less? Yes I know what kindling is and yes I read the sidebar. I wont be on a bender just binge drinking 1-2 weeks a night. Can I drink?"}

Nevertheless, may your own conscience guide you: perhaps God will use this to bless you as well.\n\nI'm going to try to keep this short and sweet (though I probably won't), intending to wrap this post up by sharing the *one* happening that encapsulates and symbolizes everything that freedom from lust has wrought within me.\n\nAlthough the ultimate reason that I practice NoFap (or, as I also call it, chastity) is to obey and grow closer to Christ, the subsidiary motivations of (1) rewiring my brain to achieve sexual *normality* and (2) healing my PIED are also powerful, powerful motivations.\n\nBy the grace of God, I have enjoyed freedom from lust\u2014in all of its forms\u2014for 94 days and counting. I don't even let my eyes rest on a female form: why shave fiery sparks onto a pile of very, very dry wood? Should God ever bless me with a wife, then I will rest my eyes on her and her alone.\n\nI am 37 years old, and my long addiction to lust had warped and bent me inside: I used to look at things that now make me shudder. I felt so *filthy*, but that filthiness and twisting of everything that was good and pure in this world was precisely the *tang* that I craved. I had no normal sexual desires and no normal libido.\n\nI am also an alcoholic. I drank for sixteen years, and I have now been sober for 20 months and counting\u2014rehab, AA, the whole nine yards. AA saved my life.\n\nThose two addictions fed off of each other and amplified one another for *years*, and in that swamp of isolated, lonely drinking, I looked at oceans of porn, and the warping and twisting and bending and sexual leprosy just metastasized within me.\n\nThroughout sobriety, I have always struggled against lust, trying to extend my recovery into that area. But, and I'm sure that most of you can relate, I would always go three or four weeks and fail. Porn became my \"new\" alcohol: when my coping mechanisms were overwhelmed, I would go on a three- or four-day porn \"bender.\"\n\nIn my experience, addiction to lust, like addiction to alcohol, is progressive. Even physical sobriety and the weeks of seeking God didn't change my sexual tastes one iota. Once I indulged, it was back to the pigpen of anti-natural, \"taboo,\" filthy, insectoid cravings.\n\nBy the grace of God, I now have freedom: though I remain vigilant.\n\nFor most of this period, I honestly wondered whether my manhood would ever work again. It was just lifeless.\n\nRecently, I met a Christian girl. Last weekend was the best weekend of my life: it was downright enchanting, and I never knew that such synergy and intimacy could exist between a man and a woman. Honestly, it was *magical*. I didn't know such a thing was even possible. And best of all, it felt *clean*. I felt *clean* and *pure* and *wholesome*, and that was **exactly** what I desperately panted after when I started this journey.\n\nAll of that to say, my emotions were overflowing, and when I went to merely hold her hand, my manhood came to life. It surprised me . . . and actually made me embarrassed: I was craving for purity *coram Deo* and was desperately worried that she would notice.\n\nBut the *best* thing about it was that *it wasn't the handholding that caused the rush of blood*: it was the **emotional contact**.\n\nI am so grateful to God that I could almost cry just thinking about it. To me, *that* is what the sex drive was meant to be, or, at least, that is its highest function. I am not degrading physical intimacy\u2014within its proper, God-ordained boundaries: I am no body-abhorring gnostic.\n\nBut I cannot tell you how incredibly grateful I was that *clean feelings of intimacy towards a girl that I care about* activated my libido.\n\nIt's the gift beyond gifts, and I wouldn't trade it for all of the filthy lust spasms in the world.\n\nAnd had I \"tested\" to see whether my PIED was cured by dipping into the pigpen, all of that snow-white purity would have been tainted.\n\nI'm rambling. I'm just very, very grateful: incredibly grateful at the healing that God can provide and for the reality of neural plasticity and rewiring.\n\nAnyhow. May we all find deeper and deeper freedom from this bondage to the Twisting and Warping that is lust!\n"}

I can mindlessly watch movies, or play video games, and im not bothered that Im not being sociable, and it gives me something to look forward to after work, and if Im still too switched on, I can dull myself some more, or drink myself to sleep.\n\nIt also really helps that I took Friday off. Thursday night, last night, and tonight, I can stay up late and watch tv in bed until I fall  asleep (since I normally need booze to sleep), and then sleep in in the morning.

I felt compelled to accept the fact that I was going to drink while there.  I managed not to buy any alcohol prior to traveling to the concert site \\(Charlotte, NC\\).  I went into the festival grounds on Friday around noon.  The triggers were everywhere.  Jack Daniels tents.  Beer tents everywhere.  I would estimate that any given day there were close to 40,000 people there by around 4 or 5 in the afternoon.  The amount of people walking around drinking from the time I got there until I left each night between 9 and 11:30 pm was truly staggering.  I really hadn't noticed it before as I had always been among the drinkers.  At the end of the festival on Sunday night I was walking back to the hotel and realized I had made it.

More and more I'm seeing that drinking is a problem and is affecting my life negatively. I grew up in AA. Literally, I remember being 5 years old and listening to the meeting while I colored. It felt like home. I loved the smell of coffee and cigarettes, and listening to deep conversations. I felt safe there, but never did I think I would end up in their seats. My mom and step father were and still are extremely active in the group. The thought of ME ever sitting in a meeting for myself? Yeah, that's crazy \\- but I'm seeing now that I probably need it.\n\nI began drinking socially every Friday night out with friends about a year and a half ago. Before then I could go out to bars and clubs, and have no desire to drink. I didn't understand the appeal until my first drunken night and it was over from there. I was at the time \\(now engaged and living with my fianc\u00e9\\) a single mom who needed the outlet. But I began going out more, leaving my son with babysitters. The time out got longer and how drunk I was got worse. I remember experiencing my first hangover and saying I'll never do that again. That was a lie. I was drinking to get over my narcissistic ex whom I was deeply in love with and hurt by.\n\nFast\\-foward to when I met my fianc\u00e9 a little over a year ago. I was the party girl, but I hated that because I never was that way before. When I met him, suddenly CRAZY behavior started coming out. I would go insane sometimes, fighting with him. I was always the fun drunk but something about him made me lose a screw. One night I became drunkenly suicidal after what was supposed to be a fun night out with him and friends. I've had several of those, all with him. I feel so bad for what I've put him through... Honestly, I was horrible. Because of that, we quit \"going out\" and binging. Now we take it easy more at home. When we have gone out, I prove to him I won't binge drink. It's manipulation so that he will think I'm fine and without a problem when I drink at home. I think, \"ok, don't get sloppy drunk. Get a little buzz, but no hangover the next morning... that way you can drink regularly at home. You need that more than a party one night\". Crazy! Just this past weekend we went out with friends and I watched a few of my friends get shit\\-faced. I told my fianc\u00e9, \"aren't you happy I'm not drinking like that anymore?\" It's disgusting, but I did that to get the \"free pass\" to drink more. If I'm not out of control \\(seemingly\\) then he won't be mad at me for drinking. I've even began to hide it, though. :\\(\n\nYet, my drinking at night never stopped. I now have a glass or two of wine, but pour extra when he's not looking. I've even moved on to hard liquor.  I'm getting skilled at pretending I'm not drunk, but I am almost every single night. Last night he wasn't home \\- he hasn't been home for a week due to a business trip. I drank EVERY NIGHT, alone. Last night I got hammered. I drank a whole bottle of wine \\(I'm petite\\) and made a huge mistake that will likely ruin my relationship. I woke up the next morning and told myself I'm going to quit. I considered a meeting, but wouldn't want my fianc\u00e9 to know I was going, so I didn't go. I don't want to admit I have a problem. If I admit that, then I have to really quit. Does that make sense? Like I would normally be having my first drink of the night \\(9pm\\) after my son is asleep... but I'm TRYING to resist. I honestly might drink tonight.... but at least I'm admitting this. I'm afraid of quitting because I equate drinking with fun. How will I ever have fun or mask any of my emotional pain again? UGH. This sucks. I want to stop, but I can't!!!\n\nBecoming sober always sounds appealing until I want a drink."}

I'm 5 days sober and wanted to share what got me here.\n\nTo preface this, I am a small person. 5'0 and 115 pounds. So if my drinking doesn't seem excessive, it was for a person of my stature.\n\nI used to drink like a \"normal person.\" I even used to work at a bar. I would never drink at work except to maybe have a shot with a customer to entice them to also buy a shot or afterwards when I was cleaning I would have one beer.\n\nI remember going to a Mexican restaurant frequently with my sorority sisters and having one margarita and feeling drunk. I remember going out to dinner with my parents and having one glass of wine. I remember going to bachelorette parties and having 2 cranberry and vodkas the entire night.\n\nWhen I turned 24 I met my ex, who was the same age. He was a heavy drinker. I didn't see it at the time, and his friends used to call him a combination of \"DR + his name.\" So, for example, Dredward, for Drunk Edward. He wouldn't drink much during the week, but on the weekends he made up for it. On Saturdays we would get up to go to the gym and then split a 12 pack of craft beer. Then drink long into the night. We always got in bad fights while drinking because we were too far gone to be rational. He pissed his pants multiple times, would pass out on walls at pizza shops at 2 in the morning, and even tried to eat a tree once. His friends thought it was hysterical. I tried to keep up with him and also noticed myself gaining a lot of weight. Ultimately, we split right before Christmas when we were both 27 and I was devastated. I thought I was going to get engaged, instead I got dumped. It didn't hit me until about a month later. \n\nFor the first few months of 2017, I was having a beer or two every night to just calm my nerves. Ol' reliable was good old Bud Light Lime, or BLL as I referred to it. Soon one or two turned into a 6 pack to myself. I liked how I didn't feel feelings anymore. This went on until I moved to a big city in May of 2017. Right before I moved, my ex briefly came back into my life. There was even talks of him coming to visit me. Then the night before I moved I had around 20 BLL's and texted him a mess of shit that I didn't even remember. Nail in the coffin.\n\nI moved to my new city and felt so lonely. My friends I did have there all had their own lives - one had a new boyfriend, the other was married, and the other was working 2 jobs. I hadn't made any friends at work yet. I was trying to online date but failing miserably. The only thing that made me feel better was getting completely annihilated and forgetting everything.\n\nIn July of 2017 I met a man 10 years older I would have a summer fling with. This was when my life truly started to spiral. He had many friends that have died from heroin and would self medicate with alcohol. He would drink 20+ beers on a Saturday, and then spend most of Sunday drinking. He never told me how he felt except for when we were drunk. I tried to keep up with him too, and eventually every time I was with him I had no less than a 12 pack to myself of Coors Light. I blacked out constantly. I would wake up and scramble for my phone to see who I had texted, what I tweeted, and which Snapchats I needed to delete. \n\nThis went on for months. By October 2017 I had dropped my phone in salsa and left it there for hours before I realized what I did. Miraculously it still worked. I pissed my pants at 28 years old, more than once. I fell off a friends porch and missed cracking my skull by about an inch. My parents were starting to get really concerned.\n\nIn November of 2017 I went to a winery in a party bus with my girlfriends and was a mess. I fell on top of everyone in the limo, broke a wine glass, and have zero recollection of everything from getting dropped off at the limo on. By December of 2017 it was just one thing after another. I was off work for 11 days and went on a complete bender. I had a 12 pack plus whatever I could get my hands on daily. I drank a bottle of wine in an hour on Christmas Day. New Years I barely remember. Even after the New Year I continued on for another week and a half, until finally, I was tired of feeling like shit and decided to cut back. \n\nMy drinking stayed on an even keel for a while. I had started dating someone who also has dealt with addiction in his past. We both even managed to get through St. Patrick's Day unscathed. But right around April I derailed again. I was going to brunch and ended up drinking every Sunday, all day Sunday, constantly. After I moved to a trendier part of my city, there was more opportunities to drink, being that I lived next to a convenience store and had a bar within walking distance. I had a housewarming on Cinco De Mayo and yet again woke up with the worst anxiety the next day because I remembered nothing. I continued to go to brunch on Sundays and derail.\n\nBy my birthday in the middle of May I was spiraling. My parents came and visited and took me to a nice dinner. I had 3 glasses of wine in the hour and a half we were there and then more when I got home. I went out after and had about 5 more glasses. I got irrationally angry when none of the kitchens at the restaurants downtown were open at 2 in the morning. I tried directing the uber driver to the wrong mcdonalds and we went completely out of the way. My boyfriend even made a comment about how much wine I had. \n\nOn my actual birthday, I woke up depressed. I have bipolar disorder and am on a good combination of medicine. But the depression won that day. And this is what started a depressive episode from that day onward. I had 4 glasses of red wine at my birthday dinner. And then was having at least a beer or two every night when I got home from the gym.\n\nAs I drank more and my depressive episode continued to eat away at me, I started to think of suicide. It didn't make any sense. I had a wonderful life. I had been at my government union job that gives me a 4% raise every year and allows me to retire at 55 with a pension for a year now. I had a wonderful boyfriend. I lost all my weight and even my \"skinny clothes\" from college were falling off me. Everyone kept telling me how great I looked but I felt like shit constantly.\n\nAnd then, I was drunk for 72 hours. I was on my balcony sobbing to my best friend and asking if she would promise me she'd take my cats in if I killed myself. I had gotten in a bar fight earlier in the evening. The next day I drank and went to a playoff basketball game downtown that I had spent $300 for tickets in the nosebleeds for and didn't remember any of the fourth quarter. The next day I found myself sobbing on the phone with my mother at the bar at 7:30 that night with my sunglasses on chugging as many beers as I could get. I told her I try so hard to get the depression to go away but it doesnt. It was eating away at me in a way it never had before. Even though I tried to drink it away, it was still there.\n\nI ended up going home and committing what was and will be my first, last, and only suicide attempt. My boyfriend found me barely breathing. He took me to the bathroom and shoved his fingers down my throat and I threw up blood and passed out. He called 911 and as they were taking me away in the ambulance yelled \"Is she going to be okay?\" and the EMTs couldn't tell him anything because we're not married.\n\nI spent the entire night in the emergency room and sent to a treatment center the next day. On the way there, the EMT gave me my phone back and I turned it on to a flood of texts from my boyfriend about how the world needs me and how he needed me. I called him and have never heard a man cry like that in my life. The hospital called my parents and my sister told me my mom collapsed after the call. Everything was still not setting in at this point.\n\nWhen they took me to treatment, I found out I was pink slipped, which means I had to stay there for at least 72 hours. At first I was so angry and still didn't think I had a problem, and even thought to myself \"I'll just never post pictures on Snap or Facebook with alcohol ever again. I'll hide it.\" But then reality was setting in. I couldn't lose my job that I had worked so hard to get. I had the time to take off work but I was scared the union wouldn't protect me. I hurt everyone around me in ways I never thought possible. I was stuck in a treatment center wearing hospital socks, my boyfriends sweatpants, and my roommates t shirt because my clothes I came in with had blood all over them. During a smoke break, someone told me the more activities you go to throughout the day, the faster you'll get out. I also signed myself in so I was likely to get out after the pink slip expired. \n\nI was determined to get out of there so I went to everything: yoga in the morning, art therapy and group therapy twice a day, and AA meetings at night. My boyfriend visited me that night and I've never seen someone look so scared or broken. It was when I saw his face I knew I could never do this to ANYONE again. The next night when my parents came up was even worse. I had never seen them cry like that. My dad said he's going to be worried every time the phone rings. I told him I was going to stop drinking and he said \"No you won't.\" I wanted to prove him wrong. \n\nAt first I thought that I would just take a hiatus and then try to drink like a normal person again, but after an AA meeting on my 3rd day it all hit me. I can't drink like a normal person again. I've tried before limiting myself to a glass of wine at a Christmas party last year and ended up having 5. I tried going to the bar for \"just one\" but it was never just one. I had to be sober. The lady running the AA meeting said, \"You can not. Pick. Up.\" And I knew I couldn't.\n\nAlcohol almost ruined my life. I now realize it's a depressant, and just makes everything worse. Had I succeeded in my attempt, I would have devastated people who care about me. I've ruined relationships. I noticed some of my friends distancing themselves from me. My parents were worried all the time. I had a wonderful life that I could have thrown away.\n\nI am now 5 days sober and I've never felt better in my life. I have a new lease on life. I've never been more excited to be alive, to be back in my own bed, to see my cats, to kiss my boyfriend. I've never been more excited to talk to my parents on the phone or text my friends or go to my job. I'm learning how to wakesurf this weekend, something I never though I'd be able to do.\n\nI know this is going to be a hard weekend to get through, but the prospect of making people I care about feel the way they felt a few days ago and going back to treatment are enough to make me never want to drink again.\n\nI had to hit rock bottom to get better. But at 29, I'm glad my rock bottom came early before the DUI's, the jailtime, the failed marriages, and getting my kids taken away. I am lucky that in the short time I spiraled nothing ever happened criminally.\n\nI am determined that I will never have a drink again.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nIWNDWYT."}

Skipping work, puking every day, blackouts etc. \n\nMy wife and I, when we first met, would get drunk and laugh etc until she noticed that I\u2019d become a massive prick the more I drank. Not abusive, just argumentative and annoying. So I started drinking in secret. On the way home from work (bus not driving), any time I went to buy groceries - so she wouldn\u2019t see it. I\u2019m a highly functioning alcoholic most of the time.\n\nThen one night about two years ago, I woke about 3am drunk as hell, sat on the edge of the bed and started urinating, thinking I was on a toilet. She woke and so did I.  Rather than lie and make out I was \u2018sleep walking\u2019 or something , I broke down and told her the truth. I\u2019ve got a problem. And I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nThe next day she organised an appointment with a drugs and alcohol counsellor whom I saw for around six months once a week. They booked me in for a ten day detox and off I went. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the most positive experience for me tbh. I spent ten days being berated for choosing booze over the \u2018important things\u2019 in life and once my time was done, the first thing I did when I left was buy a bottle of wine to drink on the way home. More as a \u2018fuck you\u2019 than anything else. I\u2019m well aware of how destructive and stupid that was. \n\nThat was a year ago. \n\nAnd although I don\u2019t drink as much as I did I\u2019m still drinking heavily but exclusively in secret. Because as I said I can drink and hide it very well. \n\nBut I\u2019m killing myself. And I have so many reasons to be sober. But I can\u2019t seem to shake this bullshit. \n\nEvery time I drink I hate myself. Every day I wake and say \u2018nope not today\u2019 yet find myself on auto pilot buying booze and tipping it down my throat. \n\nPlease forgive the long, self pitying rambling. I just wanted to be open and honest about this in a forum of people that might understand.  \n\nI\u2019ve tried AA and the whole god thing irks me. I don\u2019t have any other groups near me. \n\n\n"}

In High School I started binge drinking with friends. My friends would steal it and their parents would buy it for us. I was drinking then because it was \u201cfun\u201d but what I did not know was this was the start of a horrible addiction I would live with for the rest of my life. \n\tI joined the Marine Corps right out of High School at 18 years old and within four months of being in I had older Marines buying me alcohol and we would drink together in the barracks. I was stationed in Virginia at the time and there was a strict zero tolerance policy at my unit for drinking underage. One day I met a guy in the Navy who had a moonshine connection and I started getting it from him. It wasn\u2019t long until someone snitched, and I was NJP\u2019d for it. I lost my rank, had half pay for 2 months, and was put on 2 months of restriction. Despite this punishment, I continued to drink in secret and just got better at hiding it from people. \nAfter Virginia, I came to 29 Palms, CA for my permanent duty station in 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines. Soon after checking into the unit, I found out we were deploying to Afghanistan in a few short months. I quickly found a group of friends and began binge drinking more than I ever had. The rules were a lot less strict than in Virginia and it was easy to get away with. While I was on deployment, we were given beer for the Marine Corps Birthday which I thought was ironic because they enforce zero tolerance on underage drinking, yet they were giving it to underage Marines knowingly. \n\tAfter I returned from Afghanistan, I started partying harder than ever. I was intoxicated more than I was sober, and I got a fake ID and began going out to clubs and bars. I eventually began doing other drugs like cocaine and LSD. They were very easy to get out in 29 Palms and my friends and I were using them often. I became dependent, primarily on alcohol and couldn\u2019t go a day without it. I had a problem but refused to believe that I was an alcoholic. After all, my good friends were doing the same thing.\n\tDeployment number 2 rolled around in early 2015 and this time I was headed to Kuwait. With nothing to do in Kuwait, I started buying bottles of Nyquil and other medications and abused them. I also had a friend of mine send me liquor in the mail as alcohol was banned in Kuwait. I remember another friend had his wisdom teeth pulled and was prescribed oxycodone. We drank and snorted those pills and at the same time would inhale cans of aerosol to get q quick high. My life wasn\u2019t going in the direction I had thought it would at all. In fact, I was really depressed, and I was using these drugs to cope.\n\tIt only got worse when I got back from my second deployment. The first weekend back I went to Knotfest, a 2-day concert, and did tons of ecstasy and cocaine at the show. As the months went by, the addictions worsened and so did my depression. Eventually, it started affecting my relationships. I became very turned off from the world and drank to pass out every night. When I found out 3/7 was going to deploy me again I slumped, and then my ex cheated on me and that was the last straw. I was out of control, getting jumped at bars and even got arrested a couple times. I was so depressed and convinced my life was over and there was nothing good for me. One day I got the courage to go into mental health and talk about my depression and anxieties. I was referred to the alcohol abuse rehab and began doing Outpatient Rehab classes.\nEven though I began going to AA and the alcohol rehab classes, I was still very depressed and struggling with my sobriety. Eventually my 5-year contract with the Marines was done so I was a free man. After getting out of the Marines I was significantly happier and stopped taking my antidepressants. My mood was better, but my habits had not changed. I was still drinking in excess, and driving while intoxicated, however, I quit doing the hard drugs. I got rolled up again in October of 2017 this time for a DUI and have been sober ever since. Once I had hit rock bottom my mindset changed. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with alcohol or drugs. From the $20,000 in court and lawyer fines and fees, injuries and health problems I\u2019ve faced, and depression and anxiety alcohol has caused me I\u2019m done with it for good. I am now 7 months sober and happier than ever, and I plan to stay sober for good. \n"}

By the age of 17 or so I knew very explicitly knew that I couldn\u2019t achieve things if I was drinking. I quit drinking for a few years in high school because I wanted to go to a good college and get as far away from my home town as possible. I chose to go to a college known for its terrible party scene because I didn\u2019t want to fall back into the habits I had in early high school. I made it about 3 weeks at college without drinking and since then it has been a constant struggle. College was what I thought it would be if I drank through it\\- a series of failures. I probably looked like a normal average student from the outside but I struggled academically, emotionally, and socially.\u00a0\n\nAfter college was more of the same. Things came to a breaking point a few years ago and I started going to AA on and off. I was sober for a little over 5 months. Many things about that time period we\u2019re great. I have never felt so comfortable in my own skin. I didn\u2019t make embarrassing phone calls to relatives or exes. I felt respected at work and I started to respect myself. I felt hopeful. My big problem is that as soon as I stop drinking I get so much better so quickly and I lose motivation and feel like not drinking is costing more than it is giving me. I am motivated by pain, and the pain goes away quickly. Since I started drinking again about a year and a half ago I have been in a pattern of not drinking for a few weeks, things are good, I feel like I can handle a few light beers, and I can\u2019t. I am so desperate to break out of this pattern. It is so frustrating and demoralizing. I drive drunk, my personality changes in ways I don\u2019t like, I do embarrassing things, I come frighteningly close to being unfaithful to my partner, I don\u2019t achieve anything, I spend the day after drinking sobbing intermittently and reflecting on what a piece of shit I am.  I so badly want things to be different this time, but I said that two weeks ago, and two weeks before that, and two months before that, and two years before that, etc.\u00a0\n\nI am going to try again and am going to try differently. I am going to start writing about my experiences so that I have a response when I ask myself why it would be such a big deal to have a few drinks. I am going to start going to engage with communities like this one. I am going to do a lot of reading. I am going to cultivate interests and hobbies and spirituality that don\u2019t have to do with drinking. I am going to try and find ways to stay motivated once the pain subsides.\u00a0"}
{"author": "AmIonFire", "creation_date": "2018-05-14 15:07:58", "selftext": "\\(TL;DR\\- from rock\\-bottom to Citizen of the Year!\\)\n\n12 years ago, I got an OUI, and was forced to attend a few local AA meetings as part of my probation. I was \\*not\\* sober, knew inside that I was an alcoholic, but I wasn\u2019t ready to admit that or quit. So I attended the meetings, sat quietly in the back and skipped out right away, after getting my little card signed. During one of those meetings, I met C, who was celebrating 16 years sober. The idea of 16 years sober was insane to me! I was impressed, it seemed like a super\\-human feat to me. He\u2019s about 20 years older than me, white\\-haired, soft\\-spoken. The idea of him being drunk seemed outrageous\n\nNow, I live in a small town, so I knew C by face, but after that meeting, we became slightly closer aquaintances, exchanging small talk in line at the post office, greeting each other by name at the grocery store. Eventually he gave me his business card \\(he is a handyman\\) and I hired him to fix a few things. He gave me a ride to work once and a while. We just became basic friends.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I decided to try to quit drinking, and I started voluntarily attending AA. C was happy to see me there, even gave me rides to meetings a couple times. By that time, he had over 20 years sober, he is a high\\-ranking member of the Lions Club, as well as serving on local committies and working with the senior center and outreach programs here in town, and walking into any AA meeting with C was almost like being personally invited, like a voucher that you are the \u201creal\\-deal.\u201d I threw myself into AA, reading the Big Book every day, attending a meeting everyday \\(sometimes 2\\) I would speak up at meetings \\(when I wasn\u2019t sobbing\\), I got some laughs, lots of phone numbers, even went out to dinner with a group of people after a meeting one night\u2026\n\nAnd then\u2026I just drank. I made it 18 days before jumping off the wagon, abandoning AA, and reverting right back to my old ways. C called me a couple times but backed off when he realized what was going on. He never tried to guilt or shame me, never demanded I return, never even expressed disappointment. He continued to be my buddy, help me with soome work around my house, even when I was obviously hungover as shit, we\u2019d have coffee and talk about our kids and stuff about town, etc.\n\nIt took me another 5 years to finally get sober, and when I did, I didn\u2019t tell anyone for a while, didn\u2019t go to AA. I deleted my facebook, kept to myself, and this sub, and got through some rough times. By the time that I told C I was not drinking anymore, I had 30 or 60 days down and I was feeling confident enough in my commitment to tell him. He was so happy for me, without any kind of \u201ctold ya so!\u201d He just got all smiley and said \u201cAmi! That\u2019s great news!\u201d He told me anytime I want to go to meetings, he\u2019s still going every day,would be glad to give me a ride, and he also completely understood when I told him I felt I\u2019d do better without. We\u2019ve spent more quality time together since I got sober, he opened up about his past a bit more. He was not only an alcoholic, he was a crack\\-addict! Blows my mind to imagine that my kind and peaceful friend was someone I would not have recognized years ago! If he had not stopped when he did, the friend I have today would not exist, and for that fact, I am grateful for sobriety.\n\nA few months ago, C offered to get me a job where he works \\(in distribution\\) and it\u2019s turned out to be the best job I\u2019ve ever had! He also introduced me to a woman in town who is partially\\-disabled and too proud to apply for home\\-care. C has done a lot of work on her house, and I am now also a part\\-time housekeeper for her. Turns out she was one of the teachers at my high school, and rather than clean her house and leave, I end up sitting with her chatting out school, books, politics. It\u2019s not a lot of money for cleaning up a few times a week, but the feeling I come home with is amazing. I\u2019m helping someone, and she enjoys the company. It\u2019s hard to explain, but the first couple of times, I sat here and cried when I got home, just at how good it feels to do something that is making a difference in someone\u2019s life. When I tried to explain this feeling to C, he suggested I join the Lions Club. I\u2019m still considering; most of my life I have been the unreliable one and I\u2019m still afraid of making any kind of commitment to anyone, but I\u2019m getting there!\n\nAnyway, to wrap this up, I will get to the actual point that made me write this! My town has a big parade and celebration for the 4th of July, and there is a ceremony to award the \u201cCitizen of the Year.\u201d Working in distribution for our local newspaper, I\u2019m one of the first to see each week\u2019s headlines, and last week, on the front cover in full color, was the announcement that my friend C has been voted this year\u2019s \u201cCitizen of the Year\u201d! I am so proud of him, so inspired! I called to congratulate him this morning, and said, \u201cNow think back about 25 years ago, and just imagine\\- Citizen of the Year? You\u2019ve come a long way, baby!\u201d LOL\n\nI have never attended the award ceremony on the 4th, as the bandstand is not near the beer garden, and last year, I skipped the entire celebration altogether. This year, I have a reason to show up, front and center, to cheer on my friend and mentor! I will end this with one of the wisest things C has said to me\u2026we were sitting outside at work and I was playing on my phone, looked at my badge on this sub, told him I was on day 300 \\(or whatever the specific number was\\) I said something like \u201cIf you were on this site, your badge would be like 5 million days or something!\u201d And he said \u201cEh, we are both working on the same day\\- today, and today is the only day that matters.\u201d\n\nI am so proud of all of the people I am not drinking with today!"}
{"author": "Kitchenjunkie", "creation_date": "2018-05-12 15:06:51", "selftext": "Today is my birthday. I woke up at a stark ravingly mad 4:30 am and read a few short stories from a David Sedaris book. \n\nNow I\u2019m feeling nostalgic, but I rarely post and I\u2019m getting close to my 2 year sobriety date, so what the heck. Get ready for a long post.\n\nTL;DR: it gets better, and I\u2019m feeling grateful that it does.\n\nI was reminiscing about alcohol this morning. How two years ago I would have celebrated with morning mimosas, afternoon patio beers, a few glasses of wine with dinner, a couple whiskeys as a nightcap. (You know the deal) Not a craving. Just kind of like remembering an old friend who has moved away. \n\nBut yesterday I PRed my deadlift (something I had not been able to achieve while drinking because I kept getting injured - turns out your body can\u2019t heal itself properly after workouts if you\u2019re drunk all the time), had a minor surgical procedure to add badly needed hormones to my blood stream (my body doesn\u2019t make testosterone, and this hormone imbalance makes me severely depressed. I\u2019ve had two more of these procedures this year, and I\u2019m less depressed than I\u2019ve been at 31 than I\u2019ve been since I was 9. I never made it s priority to seek medical help when I was drinking because I was too embarrassed at how much I drank to talk to a doc), I have more deep, meaningful friendships than I\u2019ve ever had in my life, yesterday I taught myself a new song on the ukulele, my dog is healthy and happy (now I walk him daily - when I was drinking we were both on the chubby side because my drunk ass was glued to the couch), I\u2019m stronger and healthier than I\u2019ve ever been - both mentally and physically, I read for pleasure nearly every day now, and I\u2019ve found that after almost 2 years of sobriety, my brain is healing. \n\nI can genuinely enjoy things without a drink now. This is particularly apparent at concerts. When I was attending shows in my first 6 months - 1 year sober, it just wasn\u2019t fun any more. The music didn\u2019t sound as good. I attend shows throughout the year, and I\u2019ve come to enjoy them more over time (a weird way to track my brain chemistry but it\u2019s a noticeable change). Plus I don\u2019t feel obligated to stay all the way to the end now if I\u2019m tired or not feeling it. I protect my time. \n\nI spend time with loved ones talking or doing puzzles instead of drinking and watching tv. \n\nAn old friend with limited mobility whom I hadn\u2019t heard from in months called me the other day to ask if I\u2019d help her with her vegetable garden. I was feeling down that day and almost told her no, but I sucked it up and dug in the dirt for 4 hours in the blazing hot sun, and it was one of the most meaningful experiences I\u2019ve had in a while - helping someone else instead of feeling sorry for myself and isolating.\n\n I\u2019ve opened a new savings account and I\u2019m working on opening a retirement account (I never did this before because 1. I never had any money to save and 2. I was sure I\u2019d die before I got old enough to retire).\n\n My job is hard, but for the most part okay. I\u2019m someone my team can depend on, and I am relieved daily that any time I make a mistake it\u2019s not because I was drunk but rather that I tried my best and it didn\u2019t work out.\n\nAt 23, I thought I was too young to have a drinking problem (but I knew I did), so I put off quitting. At 29 I finally committed and was fucking terrified at the thought of never having a drink for the rest of my life. 2 years later, I can tell you it gets better. Your brain and body heal themselves. It\u2019s incredible. I won\u2019t say I\u2019ll never have a drink again (can\u2019t get cocky). Sometimes all I want to do is shut down and zone out. Those days staying sober is fucking hard. But I munch some candy or ice cream and go to bed early. Sometimes the craving lasts for weeks, but it passes eventually.\n\nI don\u2019t regret not getting sober sooner. I know what happened in my life needed to happen for me to be determined enough to stick to it. This is my second birthday sober in 10 years. And it might not be perfect (spent my bday in japan last year- that\u2019s hard to beat!), but I feel pretty grateful that I\u2019m working on getting better,  and if you\u2019re here reading this, you are too, and I\u2019m glad for both of us. It gets better. &lt;3"}
{"author": "flattster", "creation_date": "2018-05-17 05:48:39", "selftext": "I'm going to start off with my qualifier is doing very well right now. She has completed outpatient rehab, and has been alcohol free for 5 weeks. She does have a scram bracelt but she understands how bad things were and wants to get better, she doesn't want to go back to drinking every night. \n\n\nI didn't like how her drinking was going after we had our last child, within just a couple months of baby being born she was drinking again. I'm not certain she was always sober when breast feeding, I came home one night to her passed out in the rocking chair with baby falling out of her lap late at night. I always rationalized she had a lot to deal with since I worked 3 night shifts per week  plus two days shifts and we had two under 18 months in the house. Our babies always had attention and she worked very hard to keep the babies ahead of their milestones. These babies knew nothing but smiles. \n\nFast forward 3 years and I realized how bad the drinking was when I had came home at midnight to her passed out, I went to bed. Shortly after that the security alarm tripped and she didn't wake up. That was when my attitude changed and I decided I needed to protect the babies, now 4&amp;5 and I started challenging her sobriety when I need to work at night. \n\nOver the next 14 months I progressively policed and tried to find ways to work with her, not to stop the drinking all together, just when I was gone. Nothing work, she failed every promise. Finally it all came to an end when I came home to her passed out at 3:30p.m. and one child hadn't been brought back from school. I retrieved said child ce back to check on her since I never check her pulse, to find her wandering through the house with a bottle of pills in her hand. She had made quite a few previous threats at suicide and a friend told me to be aggressive if it happened again. So a friend and I agreed it was time and we had her taken to the hospital to sober up and be evaluated. She still harbors anger over this.\n\nThe next morning I picked her up from the hospital at about 7, took her home and took the kids to school. I came home and we talked only a little as I was exhausted. I took a nap and she was to pick up our youngest from school at 11:30. I woke up at 1:00 to see missed calls and texts which hardly anyone ever gets a hold of me. She had been in a DUI accident and was in the hospital. \n\nI had cleared the house of alcohol but forgot about a bottle of cointreau. I found out later she had started drinking when I left to drop the kids off at school, I was blindsided, I didn't imagine when I laid down for a nap she had already been drinking. She remembered nothing until the airbags deployed and nothing after until the hospital again. \n\nThat's the big picture. I still sit back and wonder if I shouldn't have done some things. I felt like everything I did was in reaction to finding out things weren't working as they were. First alarm she didn't wake up to, we had a serious talk and she was to cool it while I was at work. Multiple times of her being passed out when I came home, eventually she promised no drinking while I was gone, that failed, so then it was potioned beers, but then she was hiding additional. So then it was a wild goose chase finding stashes and getting rid of them. It just kept going and going and our relationship turned to me harboring anger that she couldn't stop, made it so I was always mad at her. I knew it was the disease, but knowing that didn't help me protect the children while I worked.  \n\nShe's in an after care program and has gone to counseling for a few months now as well. She doesn't talk about specifics of the AA meetings. So all I know to do is make sure she is able to make it to everything and I am perfectly willing to drive. Also I only know to make sure she gets extra attention. I don't know how to  tell her that I am proud and am happy with her progress, I try. Lastly I have tried to remind myself the brain needs to rewire, she needs to relearn so I try to be more patient about emotions. The court process is a real damper on her mood, with summer coming up and she doesn't want people to see the bracelet as well as not being able to swim. Also she's very concerned about relearning to be in social situations without drinking and people are used to us drinking as well. "}
{"author": "2_Boozy", "creation_date": "2018-05-11 16:55:53", "selftext": "Hello to everyone on this incredible forum. \n\nLike lots of people on here, I\u2019m sure, I feel very scared to write this. I lurked on this forum constantly about two months ago, during which time I quit drinking for around twenty days, before it all collapsed. The community here is the one of the most special things I think I\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019m grateful for everyone out here doing what they do.  \n\nI\u2019m here because I know deep down in my heart that I have a very big drinking problem. I have tried my best to ignore it for as long as I possibly could as I work in the drinks trade \\(I am, in fact, sat within a wall of beer at work right now\\) but I am a problem drinker and there is no way for me to hide from it anymore. \n\nDrinking has been a very prominent part of my life for as long as I can remember. My dad passed away in my teens due to alcoholism. He was never really seen without a drink, although I never really considered that unusual as it was all I had known for him, and we spent many a happy weekend\\-afternoon running around beer gardens as children. My mum drinks pretty much daily, not heavily by any stretch of the imagination, but a drink at the end of a long day has been burned into my cranium as the adult treat that everyone gets to enjoy. As a teenager I started drinking relatively heavily with friends as we navigated the new pastures of being able to get past the bouncers guarding the doors of the bars and clubs in town. It was fun then, and not being able to recall the events of the previous evening was part and parcel of the experience, I thought. I noticed others not wanting to play as hard as I did, but I thought they had low tolerances and I wore my own high tolerance like a badge of honour. As I entered my twenties I continued to be the last girl standing, even if I was staggering more than standing. I started working in bars when I was in my late twenties, and arriving so late to the industry game meant that I had a lot of catching up to do. Free post\\-shift drinks were a starter pistol and I walked home as the sun came up more often than I care to remember, and often I couldn\u2019t. \n\nWhilst working in bars I met the love of my life. We were both in other relationships at the time but when we talked and got to know each other we fell more deeply in love than I had ever considered possible. Naturally, this brought an end to both of our relationships and we embarked on a love affair that has brought me joy beyond my wildest dreams. For better or for worse, though, we are both big drinkers who love nothing more than unwinding with a beautiful beer. When drinking together is good we have the time of our lives, laughing and joking and making love and seeing the world through rose\\-tinted glasses. When bad, we fight and scream until we\u2019re blue in the face, and awake the next morning hungover and regretful. \n\nI know in my heart that most of our drinking\\-related problems are caused by my inability to stop once I have started. More than that, I become deeply insecure when drunk and lash out at him because of a deep\\-seated fear that he will walk away from me. The irony of drinking myself into oblivion, and then verbally attacking my true love or at the very least needing him to walk me home as I weigh heavy on his arm so that he *doesn\u2019t* leave me isn\u2019t lost. I think often about the lust for life I gave him when I handed him my heart and then about the shattering disappointment he must feel now that he finds himself with a girl who sold him a lie. Because when we fell in love we stayed up until dawn drinking, but that was supposed to end. We were supposed to build a life together and clean up our act and whilst he does everything he can to live a clean and healthy life, he is brought back down by me and my insatiable thirst. I am his enabler, and all I ever wanted to do was nurture him; like pouring a pint of beer on a houseplant then stubbing a cigarette end out in the soil.\n\nLast night we met up for drinks after a very stressful day. My boy has gone away today for the weekend, so goodbye drinks seemed like the perfect way to spend the evening. With empty stomachs we charged forth, which lead to heated bickering and soon arguing. Bowing under the weight of the day\u2019s earlier struggles, I turned to my glass instead of my boy for comfort. I soon lapped him and when his frustrations rightly got the better of him he stood up to leave. Four or five pints had unshackled my inhibitions and I grabbed him and flailed at him and tried to stop him from walking away. He pushed me off and because I had drank so much I fell to the floor and into a group of people. He left and I cried on the shoulder of a person with a face I can\u2019t recall. I stumbled off on a fifteen minute walk that must have taken thirty and when a car drove by and offered to take me home I did the stupidest thing I have ever done and got in. When I woke up I knew I was technically safe and unharmed, despite not recalling much of anything since I had fallen. I have done this enough to know how to reassure myself. My things were there, my keys and my clothes, I checked my body for bruises, but I don\u2019t know how to check how much damage I did to my soul, or how to check my boy\u2019s heart so that I can see for myself that there\u2019s no crack down the centre because of me. \n\nStill slightly drunk, we argue. Even now in the late afternoon my recollection of the morning is hazy. I\u2019ve long suffered with checking behaviours related to OCD and although therapy has helped to curb them, enduring blackouts as often as I do wreaks havoc on my mental health. I fill in all the black spots in my memory with wild, overly\\-imaginative, sometimes laughable, often terrifying, scenarios. As my boy packed his bags for the trip we found a way to make up and have both vowed to end this once and for all. Although I would instantly take back last night if I could, a part of me is grateful that it happened because if that\u2019s my wake\\-up call then I will consider myself to have gotten off lightly. \n\nAn AA meeting takes place in a few hours right around the corner and I am mustering up the courage to attend. I\u2019m scared and I might not go today but that\u2019s okay because I can and will go when I am ready. With my boy away I plan on going to my mums for a couple of nights and taking solace in the comfort of home and when he gets back on Monday we can start our sober life together.\n\nThank you for reading this and IWNDWYT.

I\u2019ve wanted to post to r/stopdrinking, r/howwastoday, or r/depression so many times but I always seem to flake out or lose motivation. I\u2019ve hit a particularly low low, and I seriously don\u2019t know how to pull myself back up. I have this dreadful feeling like I\u2019m about to evaporate into nothingness. I feel physically and mentally very weak. I can hardly string together a coherent sentence, and when I do it comes out barely stronger than a whimper. I have a job in a call center, which I don\u2019t think is very great for my mental well-being. In between calls my coworkers chit chat and laugh and giggle and I just don\u2019t know how they can be like that. I can hardly relate to anything positive anymore, and next to nothing gets my juices flowing.\n\nI\u2019m at the very least functional, but between obligations I either go home and cease to exist or I fill myself with red wine. I know this is a huge issue, and I\u2019ve tried giving up before, but it only lasts about a week or so. The nuts part of it all is that about 4 or 5 days in I feel fan-fucking-tastic, or at least cognizant of the new energy I seem to have. I\u2019m living in this city where leisure seems to be top priority, and where seemingly everybody besides me can handle moderating their drinks. Everyone seems so put together, and I can hardly walk down the street without thinking that the entire world can see how sad I\u2019ve become. I\u2019ve slowly been pushing away friends, simply because I can not be asked to socialize, as it\u2019s usually very taxing. \n\nI\u2019m next to financial ruin, and the looming thought of having to go home to live with my parents while I get myself back on my feet creates crazy anxiety for me. I\u2019m going to seek professional counseling soon, if I can find a cheap path for that. I need to find an AA group. I need some solice from my own psyche. I want to not feel toxic all the time. I want to be whole and I want to feel grounded and connected to myself. I\u2019m 27 years old and I feel constantly like I\u2019ve already wasted years as a drunk zombie on the couch stuffing my face with Pringles. I don\u2019t want to romanticize or make excuses for this grungy lifestyle anymore, it\u2019s not serving me. \n\nI know a few of my friends browse this subreddit, so to any of you who can put two and two together to know who I am, hit me up and let\u2019s chat. \n\nIt\u2019s 10PM and I haven\u2019t had a drink today, I think I really need to confirm today as Day 1. Not sure how to crosspost, not sure if it's necessary. This community is so positive and encouraging, I feel good finally having posted something. Thanks for your ears and for all the incredible words you have given each other, I will not drink with you today. \n"}
